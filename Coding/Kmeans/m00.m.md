%% Step 1: Preliminaries

% Files have been organized to make this exercise easier to follow.

% ================================================================

% Files are to be examined in sorted order, so sort them in your file explorer:

% m00_Preliminaries.m ... this file that sets up the paths and explains preliminaries

% m01_runkMeans.m ... the main program to run the k-means algorithm, once data has been loaded

% and once you have implemented 3 core functions it requires.

% m02_verifyYourCoreFunctions.m ... program to help you implement and verify your core functions.

% m03_playWith_kMeans.m ... program that loads some data and calls m01_runkMeans.m

% m04_optionalExercise_compressImageWithKMeans.m ... optional exercise showing another application of k-means

%

% The files that you need to complete are prefixed with "ToImplement":

% ToImplement01_ChooseRandomInitialCentroids.m

% ToImplement02_AssignSamplesToClosestCluster.m

% ToImplement03_ComputeCentroidOfEachCluster.m

%% Directories are also organized for you:

% ================================================================

% \data

% contains data of samples that we will cluster into groups via k-means

%

% \helperFunctions

% contains .m functions that help illustrate graphically what k-means is doing at each iteration.

%% Step 2: Add paths so matlab can find data and helper functions

% ================================================================

% cd <pathWhereYouStored today's course files>

addpath('data');

which data_kmeans_cloudOfPoints.mat % confirm path was added correctly

addpath('helperFunctions');

which plotkMeansState.m % confirm path was added correctly

%% Step 3: Understand our variable naming conventions

% ================================================================

% Most common coding error: variable is a different type than you think it is

%

% To avoid, prefix your variable names with the variables type:

% b ... boolean which is a variable that is true or false

% str ... variable containing a string

% n ... varaible containing an integer number

% arr1D ... 1D matrix of values

% arr2D ... 2D matrix of numeric values
