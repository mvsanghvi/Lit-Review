<u>**Periods of Human Embryology**</u>
1. Period of the egg= Time of fertilization- formation and implantation of blastocyst
	- * Egg/embryo refers to pre-fertilization
	a. Conceptus= Product of conception/fertilization
	b. Zygote= Fertilization-pre multicellular egg
	c. Morula= Zygote cleaves by mitosis, forming cluster of multiple cells/blastomeres (32-cell stage)
	d. Blastocyst= Hollow ball of cells derived from morula by forming large, fluid-filled central cavity (i.e. blastocoel)
2. Period of the embryo- Ends after 8 week gestation
	- No agreement on beginning
		- Could be from immediately after fertilization to 3 days post fertilization
3. Period of the fetus- 9th week of gestation-birth
	- Development still continues after birth, though
<u>**Phases of Human Embryology**</u>
1. Gametogenesis- In the gonads (male & female) and involves meiosis to produce haploid cells
	a. Female- Oogenesis= Production of eggs/oocytes
	b. Males- Spermatogenesis= Produce sperm/spermatozoa
2. Fertilization
	- One of the main effects- Restore diploid # of chromosomes
	- Develops the zygote (unique genome from parents)
	- Another main effect= Activates the egg
3. Cleavage
	- Different from cell division bc daughter cells 1/2 size of parents
		- Increase nucleocytoplasmic ratio (Nucleus volume: cytoplasm volume)
	- Process repeats itself to form the morula
		- Cells of the morula= blastomeres
4. Gastrulation
	- Form primitive tissue layers (i.e. germ layers)
			i. Mesoderm
			ii. Ectoderm
			iii. Endoderm
	- form 3 major axes
			i. Dorsal/Ventral (posterior/anterior)
			ii. Cranial/Caudal (superior/inferior)
			iii. Medial/lateral (midline of body)
	- Cells change positions & extensive movement relative to each other
		- Allows contact with new neighbors
			- Allows new info to be passed between cells, changing the cells' fates
5. Formation of body plan (morphogenesis)
	- Involves extensive folding of the embryo, called body folding, to go from flat disc to 3D
		- Except the umbilical cord
6. Organogenesis- Organ rudiments grow & differentiate
