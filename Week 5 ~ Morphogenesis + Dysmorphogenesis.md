[[Week 4 ~ Forming the Embryo]]

<u>PRINCIPLES OF MORPHOGENESIS AND DYSMORPHOGENESIS</u> 
- **Morphogenesis**- Form shaping process that results from differential growth, which is driven by cellular behaviors (i.e. cell shape, size, position, #, and adhesivity)  into 3D embryo with tube-within-a-tube body plan & rudiments to form adult organs/systems.
- **Dysmorphogenesis**- When cellular behaviors are perturbed during embryogenesis and result in structural birth defects due to genetic mutation and/or environmental insult
	- Examples of environmental insult= **teratogen**-agents like drugs, virus, and radiation that cause embryo/fetus malformation
	- Can result from both:
		a. Malformation- 1° morphologic defects in organ/body part due to abnormal dev events <u>directly</u> involved in said organ/part's development
		b. Deformation- 2° morphologic defects *imposed* on organ/part due to mechanical forces that are <u>indirectly</u> involved with its development
	- Can:
		a) Occur in isolated organ/part
		b) Occur as pattern of multiple  1° malformations w/ single cause (AKA a syndrome)
			i) Can be chromosomal or teratogen
