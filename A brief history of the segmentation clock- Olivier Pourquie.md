**Intro**
- Segmentation- The repetition along the body axis of similar anatomical modules (i.e. vertebrae, worm metameres)
	- Found in many animal species (both vertebrates & invertebrates)
	- Important because promotes movement
	- Is segmentation result of evolutionary convergence or of the existence of an ancestral mechanism?
	- Proceeds in sequential fashion
	- “Clock and Wavefront” model proposed in 1970's by Cooke and Zeeman 
		- Postulated the existence of a molecular oscillator (the clock) coupled to a traveling maturation wave (the wavefront) controlling the rhythmic formation of vertebrate somites.
	- “Segmentation clock” termed by Pourquie after finding  evidence for a molecular oscillator in drosophila 
		- Subsequent work identified the wavefront as traveling posterior gradients of Wnt and FGF signaling that control the spatial response to the clock oscillations

**1. Vertebrate Segmentation**
- Somites= Embryonic segments derived from the paraxial mesoderm (flanks the axial structures, ie the neural tube and notochord)
	- When formed, appear as epithelial structures
	-  Generated rhythmically at the cranial tip of the unsegmented posterior portion of the paraxial mesoderm aka PSM (which forms bilateral strips of mesenchyme extending posteriorly to the tail bud)
	- The rhythm is species-specific: 
		- 30 min in zebrafish 
		- 90 min in chicken 
		- 2 h in mouse embryos
	- The rhythm is temperature-dependent: 
		- Shorter periods observed at higher temperatures in zebrafish or chicken embryos 
	- Form two bilateral columns flanking the neural tube extending from the otic vesicle to the tip of the tail.
- Vertebrae form from the fusion of the posterior part of a somite to the anterior part of the consecutive one 

**2. The Clock and Wavefront Model**
- Christ and Menkes and Sandor demonstrated that interrupting the continuity of the PSM does not prevent the scheduled progress of segmentation
	- Also, inversion of fragments of the PSM along the antero-posterior axis leads to inversion of the progression of segmentation in the inverted fragment
		- Demonstrating a high degree of tissue autonomy of the segmentation process
			- ***Ruled out hypotheses based on long range diffusible gradients.*** 
	- Also suggested the existence of a somitic prepattern already established in the PSM
		- Using scanning electron microscopy, Meier observed up to 12 recognizable structures linearly arrayed along the chicken embryo PSM. 
			- Suggested that these structures were corresponding to the precursors of somites that he called somitomeres
				- Further experiments supported the existence of the somitomeres
				- ***Existence could not be confirmed at the molecular level and their existence has now been ruled out.*** 
	- Turing's work on reaction-diffusion proposed that periodic patterns can be generated by a set of simple biochemical interactions between diffusible molecules cross-regulating each other (1952)
		- The idea of reaction-diffusion being involved in somite formation was therefore very appealing but upon manipulations, the size of somites increased in all dimensions
			- ***Thus argued against a reaction-diffusion mechanism underlying somitogenesis***. 
				- Further theoretical arguments suggested that this type of mechanism is too sensitive to fluctuations and could hardly account for the striking robustness of somitogenesis
				- Reaction diffusion cannot be completely dismissed and periodically explored, but there is limited experimental support in favor of such a mechanism controlling the periodicity of somite formation
		- Cooke removed cells from early Xenopus gastrulae to generate smaller embryos (like Waddington and Deuchar) in the 1970s
			- Observed a decrease in somite size in smaller embryos, further arguing against control of segmentation by a reaction-diffusion mechanism. 
				- Also noted that the total somite number remained similar to that of controls in size-reduced embryos. 
- Alternative to reaction-diffusion, to explain the results, Cooke and Zeeman proposed novel “Clock and Wavefront” model
	- Involved a smooth oscillator (the clock), which controls PSM cells properties and a traveling front of maturation (the wavefront) progressing in the PSM in an anterior to posterior direction, gating the response to the oscillator
	- The clock, for which PSM cells are assumed to be phase-linked, would lead groups of cells of the anterior PSM to coordinately and periodically alter their behavior such as motility and adhesion, eventually resulting in the sequential formation of somites.
	- This abrupt change in cellular properties involved in segmental determination was equated to a mathematical catastrophe, which can be viewed in more simple terms as a bistable transition in this case
	- **The great innovation of this model was the introduction of the clock as a device to generate periodicity.** 
		- Heat-shocked amphibian embryos resulted in localized segmentation defects that were visible a few segments posterior to the last formed somite at the time of heat-shock. 
			- Suggested the existence of a traveling front of hidden changes in the PSM that could only be revealed by these experiments, supporting the idea of a wavefront. 
- Primmett and Stern were the first to support the existence of a clock by repeating the heat-shocked chicken embryos 
	- Resulted in similar segmentation defects, which in a limited number of cases were repeated with a periodicity of 6–7 somites. 
	- As this time interval corresponds to the duration of one cell cycle in the chicken embryo PSM, this led the authors to propose a model wherein the periodicity of somite formation would be controlled by the cell cycle
	- The model implies some local synchrony of the cell cycle of PSM cells, which is observed experimentally [[Somite cell cycle analysis using somite-staging to measure intrinsic developmental time]]. 
		- It argues that segmentation of the somite takes place only during a defined interval of the cell cycle, by increasing adhesion in the cohort of cells at this defined stage. 
			- Indeed, while this model also implies the existence of a clock, ***its period is much longer than somite formation and thus very distinct from the clock of the Cooke-Zeeman model.***
- Another set of important experiments from Keynes and Stern demonstrated the early determination of the somite anterior and posterior fates already in the anterior PSM providing evidence for an early segmental pattern composed of alternating cell fates.  [[ Mechanisms of vertebrate segmentation]]
- This led Meinhardt to propose a reaction-diffusion-based model whereby the anterior and posterior fates are mutually inhibiting at short range while activating each other at long range
	- In this model, the segmental unit is thus the half segment.
- **These models were at odds with the logics of the fly segmentation cascade**

**3. Discovery of the Segmentation Clock**
- The Notch pathway is conserved in vertebrates, and has segmental patterns.
	- Notch not part of Drosophila segmentation cascade.
- Harvested embryos that were hybridized with *hairy* probes had different expression patterns in PSM despite nearly same number of somites
	- Suggested expression pattern changes very fast in PSM
	- Focused on smallest time period that can be analyzed (time of one somite formation)
		- Still saw different expression patterns with embryos with same somite number
		- Suggested expression was dynamic within 90 min window of somite formation
		- Repition of patterns at each somitic cycle could be due to regular intervals
- Splitting embryos and fixing one half and culturing remaining half led to:
	- Observed traveling waves continued progression despite PSM being split into several fragments
	- Demonstrated mRNA was expressed in periodic waves that travelled
		- Called them cyclic genes
	- **Proposed existence of molecular oscillator behind the vertbrate segmentation: The Segmentation Clock**
- Notch- Synchronizes oscillations locally in PSM and controls rhythmic somite formation
	- Abscence of Notch leads to loss of synchronization that becomes salt and pepper pattern. 
	- **Vertebrate segmentation involves molecular oscillator that drives periodic Notch activity in PSM**
- *Lfng*- Important for regular periodic organization of vertebrae
	- KO mice resulted in severe segmentation defects
	- No oscillation in zebrafish
- Hes7- Hairy related gene that oscillates in PSM
	- Expression is in part downstream of Notch
	- Represses *Lfng* expression in PSM
	- KO leads to severe segmentation defects.
- Segmentation clock conserved across vertebrates
- Lack of *Lfng* in zebrafish shows while Notch oscillation is conserved, the circuitry of different oscillators is not.
