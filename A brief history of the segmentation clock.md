**Intro**
- Segmentation- The repetition along the body axis of similar anatomical modules (i.e. vertebrae, worm metameres)
	- Found in many animal species (both vertebrates & invertebrates)
	- Important because promotes movement
	- Is segmentation result of evolutionary convergence or of the existence of an ancestral mechanism?
	- Proceeds in sequential fashion
	- “Clock and Wavefront” model proposed in 1970's by Cooke and Zeeman 
		- Postulated the existence of a molecular oscillator (the clock) coupled to a traveling maturation wave (the wavefront) controlling the rhythmic formation of vertebrate somites.
	- “Segmentation clock” termed by Pourquie after finding  evidence for a molecular oscillator in drosophila 
		- Subsequent work identified the wavefront as traveling posterior gradients of Wnt and FGF signaling that control the spatial response to the clock oscillations
