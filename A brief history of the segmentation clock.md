**Intro**
- Segmentation- The repetition along the body axis of similar anatomical modules (i.e. vertebrae, worm metameres)
	- Found in many animal species (both vertebrates & invertebrates)
	- Important because promotes movement
	- Is segmentation result of evolutionary convergence or of the existence of an ancestral mechanism?
	- Proceeds in sequential fashion
	- “Clock and Wavefront” model proposed in 1970's by Cooke and Zeeman 
		- Postulated the existence of a molecular oscillator (the clock) coupled to a traveling maturation wave (the wavefront) controlling the rhythmic formation of vertebrate somites.
	- “Segmentation clock” termed by Pourquie after finding  evidence for a molecular oscillator in drosophila 
		- Subsequent work identified the wavefront as traveling posterior gradients of Wnt and FGF signaling that control the spatial response to the clock oscillations
**1. Vertebrate Segmentation**
- Somites= Embryonic segments derived from the paraxial mesoderm (flanks the axial structures, ie the neural tube and notochord)
	- When formed, appear as epithelial structures
	-  Generated rhythmically at the cranial tip of the unsegmented posterior portion of the paraxial mesoderm aka PSM (which forms bilateral strips of mesenchyme extending posteriorly to the tail bud)
	- The rhythm is species-specific: 
		- 30 min in zebrafish 
		- 90 min in chicken 
		- 2 h in mouse embryos
	- The rhythm is temperature-dependent: 
		- Shorter periods observed at higher temperatures in zebrafish or chicken embryos 
	- Form two bilateral columns flanking the neural tube extending from the otic vesicle to the tip of the tail.
- Vertebrae form from the fusion of the posterior part of a somite to the anterior part of the consecutive one 
**2. The Clock and Wavefront Model**
- experiments by Christ and Menkes and Sandor demonstrated that interrupting the continuity of the PSM does not prevent the scheduled progress of segmentation
	- Also, they showed that inversion of fragments of the PSM along the antero-posterior axis leads to inversion of the progression of segmentation in the inverted fragment, demonstrating a high degree of tissue autonomy of the segmentation process
- These experiments ruled out hypotheses based on long range diffusible gradients. 
- They also suggested the existence of a somitic prepattern already established in the PSM
	- Using scanning electron microscopy, Meier reported the observation of up to 12 recognizable structures linearly arrayed along the chicken embryo PSM. He suggested that these structures were corresponding to the precursors of somites that he called somitomeres
	- Further experiments showed that at these stages, the chicken embryo PSM does indeed contain approximately 12 somites thus supporting the existence of the somitomeres
	- However, the existence of the somitomeres could not be confirmed at the molecular level and their existence has now been ruled out. 
- Turing's work on reaction-diffusion published in 1952 proposed a theoretical explanation for how periodic patterns can be generated by a set of simple biochemical interactions between diffusible molecules cross-regulating each other 
	- The idea of reaction-diffusion being involved in somite formation was therefore very appealing and it was first tested by Waddington and Deuchar as soon as 1953
	-  This indicated that, upon such manipulations, the size of somites increased in all dimensions thus arguing against a reaction-diffusion mechanism underlying somitogenesis. 
	- Further theoretical arguments suggested that this type of mechanism is too sensitive to fluctuations and could hardly account for the striking robustness of somitogenesis
	- While the role of reaction diffusion in somitogenesis is periodically revisited (Cotterell et al., 2015; Meinhardt, 1986) and cannot be formally excluded, so far there is limited experimental support in favor of such a mechanism controlling the periodicity of somite formation
- Experiments similar to those of Waddington and Deuchar in which cells were removed from early Xenopus gastrulae to generate smaller embryos were performed by Cooke in the 1970s
	- He also observed a decrease in somite size in smaller embryos which further argued against control of segmentation by a reaction-diffusion mechanism. In addition, he also noted that the total somite number remained similar to that of controls in size-reduced embryos. 
- As an alternative to reaction-diffusion, to explain these results, Cooke and Zeeman proposed a novel theoretical model which they called “Clock and Wavefront”
	- This model involved a smooth oscillator (the clock), which controls PSM cells properties and a traveling front of maturation (the wavefront) progressing in the PSM in an anterior to posterior direction, gating the response to the oscillator
	- The clock, for which PSM cells are assumed to be phase-linked, would lead groups of cells of the anterior PSM to coordinately and periodically alter their behavior such as motility and adhesion, eventually resulting in the sequential formation of somites.
	- This abrupt change in cellular properties involved in segmental determination was equated to a mathematical catastrophe, which can be viewed in more simple terms as a bistable transition in this case
		- The great innovation of this model was the introduction of the clock as a device to generate periodicity. 
	- Experiments in which amphibian embryos were heat-shocked resulted in localized segmentation defects that were visible a few segments posterior to the last formed somite at the time of heat-shock. 
		- This therefore suggested the existence of a traveling front of hidden changes in the PSM that could only be revealed by these experiments thus supporting the existence of a wavefront. 
- However, no experiment supporting the existence of a clock were reported until the work of Primmett and Stern who repeated the heat-shock experiments in chicken embryos 
	- This resulted in similar segmentation defects which in a limited number of cases were repeated with a periodicity of 6–7 somites. 
	- Because this time interval corresponds to the duration of one cell cycle in the chicken embryo PSM, this led the authors to propose a model wherein the periodicity of somite formation would be controlled by the cell cycle
	- The model implies some local synchrony of the cell cycle of PSM cells, which is observed experimentally [[Somite cell cycle analysis using somite-staging to measure intrinsic developmental time]].
