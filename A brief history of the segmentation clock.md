**Intro**
- Segmentation- The repetition along the body axis of similar anatomical modules (i.e. vertebrae, worm metameres)
	- Found in many animal species (both vertebrates & invertebrates)
	- Important because promotes movement
	- Is segmentation result of evolutionary convergence or of the existence of an ancestral mechanism?
	- Proceeds in sequential fashion
	- “Clock and Wavefront” model proposed in 1970's by Cooke and Zeeman 
		- Postulated the existence of a molecular oscillator (the clock) coupled to a traveling maturation wave (the wavefront) controlling the rhythmic formation of vertebrate somites.
	- “Segmentation clock” termed by Pourquie after finding  evidence for a molecular oscillator in drosophila 
		- Subsequent work identified the wavefront as traveling posterior gradients of Wnt and FGF signaling that control the spatial response to the clock oscillations
**1. Vertebrate Segmentation**
- Somites= Embryonic segments derived from the paraxial mesoderm (flanks the axial structures, ie the neural tube and notochord)
	- When formed, appear as epithelial structures
	-  Generated rhythmically at the cranial tip of the unsegmented posterior portion of the paraxial mesoderm aka PSM (which forms bilateral strips of mesenchyme extending posteriorly to the tail bud)
	- The rhythm is species-specific: 
		- 30 min in zebrafish 
		- 90 min in chicken 
		- 2 h in mouse embryos
	- The rhythm is temperature-dependent: 
		- Shorter periods observed at higher temperatures in zebrafish or chicken embryos 
	- Form two bilateral columns flanking the neural tube extending from the otic vesicle to the tip of the tail.
- Vertebrae form from the fusion of the posterior part of a somite to the anterior part of the consecutive one
