[[Week 0-8 ~ Embryology Overview]]
[[Week 2 ~ Becoming Bilaminar]]

- **Gastrulation**- Heralded in by the formation of the ps (primitive streak)
- **Primitive Streak**- Thickening with midline groove which forms around D15

<u>OVERVIEW OF GASTRULATION FORMING THREE 1° GERM LAYERS</u>
- Over 3 days, the ps elongates to 1.2 of the embryonic disc. Prim groove becomes more defined
	- Ps @ cranial end expands into prim node with depression called prim pit.
	- Major body axes now identifiable
		a. Cranial-caudal
		b. Dorsal-ventral
- Epiblast cells move toward, then enter, then migrate from PS as individual cells
	- **Ingression**- Cells through PS into interior of embryo

<u>FORMATION OF DEFINITIVE ENDODERM</u>
- **Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)**- Epiblast cells move into ps on D16
	a. **Epithelium**- Sheet of cells tightly interconnect via their lateral surfaces
	b. **Mesenchyme**- Loosely connected irregularly/stellate shaped cells
	c. **Pseudopodia**- Epiblast cells elongate (flask/bottle shaped) & detach
		- Allows them to migrate through ps between epiblast and hypblast
	d. **Definitive Endoderm**- Replaces hypoblast through ppib cells 1st ingression
		- Gives rise to lining of future gut/gut derivatives

<u>FORMATION OF INTRAEMBRYONIC MESODERM</u>
- **Intraembryonic mesoderm**- 3rd germ layer formed by epiblast cells diverging into space between epiblast and nascent definitive endoderm from ps
	- Mat formed reorganizes into:
		1. Cardiogenic mesoderm
		2. Paraxial mesoderm
		3. Nephrotome/intermediate mesoderm
		4. Lateral plate mesoderm
			- Notochordal process= Primitive node @ midline undergoing 5th mesodermal cell population to form a thick wall midline test 

<u>FORMATION OF ECTODERM</u>
- Epiblast cells stop moving to and ingress through ps after Definitive Endoderm formation and remaining epiblast make up ectoderm and soon after gastrulation's done
	- Ectoderm quickly differentiates into:
		1. Neural Plate
		2. Surface Ectoderm
	- Morphogenic changes occur to 3 germ layers to form prim organ rudimentss 
		a. Reality= 2+ germ layers collab for organ rudimentary formation
		b. **Organogenesis**= Organ rudiment --> Organ systems

<u>SPECIES OF GASTRULATION = MOVING CELLS TO NEW LOCALS AND ORGAN RUDIMENTS</u>
***Fates of Epiblast Cells Depends on Site of Origin***
- Most cells in epiblast and ps are pluripotent. Specified during migration
- **Prechordal plate**= 1 of most misunderstood  structures in human embryo
	- Undergoes EMT to form craniomost midline head mesoderm
- Mesoderm formation begins during early ps stage
	-  **Cardiogenic mesoderm**- Prospective cardiogenic mesoderm in epiblast moves to middle part of ps then migrates cranially
- @ Mid-ps stage, prospective {notochord, head mesoderm, somites, intermediate mesoderm, plate mesoderm} lose prospective status
- Notochordal process fully formed by D20
	- Then is hollow tube to plate plate to solid rod
***Paraxial Mesoderm Differs in Head and Trunk***
- Somites= 1st pair at D20, block-like mesoderm condensations that form cranial to caudal until D30, with 42-44 pair flanking notochord.
	- Give rise to most of axial skeleton and caudal most pairs disappear
***Intermediate and Lateral Plate Mesoderm Forms Only in Trunk***
- IM- small cylindrical condensation that makes urinary and parts of genital system
- LPM- Flattened sheet
***Formation of Neural Plate***
- D18-D20, the thickened neural plate folds into the Neural tube, which tapers into the brain and the lateral lips give rise to the neural crest cells
	- Brain already visibly divided into:
		1. Forebrain
		2. Midbrain
		3. Hindbrain

 <u>CAUDAL ELONGATION OF EMBRYO</u>
 - Driven by neuromesodermal stem cells. 
	 - Stem cell differntiation is driven by somite formation.
		 - As somites increase, somite-derived retinoic acid increases, causes Fgf8 and Wnt to decrease, which drives differentation into neural plate
<u>1° VS 2° BODY DEVELOPMENT</u>
- PS % of embryo length: 
	- D16: 50%
	- D22: 10-20%
	- D26: Disappears
- D20- PS remnants swell to make tail bud
	- This gives rise to most caudal structures
- 1° BD= Gastrualtion
- 2° BD= Rudimentary tail formation w/o germ layer formation
