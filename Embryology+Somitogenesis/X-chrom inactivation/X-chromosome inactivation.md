# Introduction
# Lyon's Law
- "...suggested that this mosaic phenotype is due to inactivation of 1 or other X chromosome early in embryonic development"
- Variegated coat color is due to clonal growth of cells with random silencing of on X-chrom
- Main consequence of SCI is to equalize the dosage of X-linked gene expression (dosage compensation) btwn male and female mammals
- 2nd type of dosage compensation balances expression btwn X-linked genes and autosomal genes by upregulation of genes on the active X-chrom
- SCI also prevents overexpression of X-linked genes in female cells w 2 X-chromosomes
- Early studies in mice demonstrated evidence of 1/2ing X-linked gene expression
	- This pinpointed timing of random XCI
- Silencing of one allele is then clonally inherited in female somatic cells
# X inactivation centre and XCI initiation
- X-inactivation centre (XIC) required for the onset of XCI
- Location the XIC on the mouse and human X chrom was further defined by examining patterns of XCI in multiple additional cases of X;autosome translocations or other types of X rearrangements 
- Main key element turned out to be a gene that encodes a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) called X inactive-specific transcript (*Xist*)
- *XIST* was initially discovered in humans by singling out this lncRNA as a critical factor for SCI based on its location and being unique to female adult somatic cells
- *XIST*/*Xist* RNA coats the inactive X chromosome in *cis* and thus becomes detectable as a cloud within the nucleus of somatic cells using RNA_FISH
- Role of *Xist* and of all elements of the XIC which include several other lncRNAs and controlling elements is still under study
- In mice 2 waves of silencing, imprinted SCI is initiated on paternal X chromosome at D4
- Imprinted paternal XCI persists in extraembryonic tissues while it is followed by X reactivation in the ICM and random SCI at the blastocyst stage
- XCI depends on levels of *Xist* expression, which are controlled by its antisense *Tsix* and a series of lncRNAs located at the XIC
- The XIC also contains protein-coding genes Rnf12, whose product activates *Xist* expression based on its dosage
- Pluripotency factors (OCT4 and NANOG) control *Xist* and *Tsix* expression, preventing SCI in pluripotent cells
- In human and rabbits, SCI onset is delayed and the paternal/maternal X chromosome is randomly silenced in some cells at early stages of development
	- Thus skips the imprinted XCI observed in mice
- *Tsix* doesn't regulate *Xist* in humans 
- Initiation of XCI may be stochastic w subsequent selection cells with appropriate number of X chromosomes expressed
# XCI spreading
- How exactly *Xist* RNA spreads along the X chromosome is still controversial
- One possibility is that *Xist* RNA binds to preferred sites in a saltatory way and spreads from a limited # of recruitment sites
- Proteins recruited by *Xist* RNA, which directly or indirectly facilitate gene silencing
	- SHARP (AKA SPEN) interacts with *Xist* RNA and recruit SMRT that activates the histone deacetylase HDAC3 for silencing
- Most enriched proteins is the nuclear matrix protein HnrnpK, which is involved in recruitment of the PRC1/2 complexes for deposition of the repressive marks H2AK119ub and H3K27me3
- Histone modifications including deacetylation of histones, methylation of H3K27 and ubiquitination of H3K119 are early events in establishing silencing
- The A-repeat within the *Xist* gene is essential for gene silencing and is a key element for the binding interactors
- Silencing is less efficient along autosomal regions, suggesting that specific elements enriched on the X help spreading and maintence
- Inefficient discontinuous spreading is observed along autosomal segments with few L1 elemnts
- Cell selection plays important role in observed patterns of inactivation in X autosome translocations, which should be interpreted w caution
# XCI maintenance
- Key molecular feature that locks silencing
	- DNA methylation at CpG islands of X-linked genes
- Different genes becomes silent at different times in concordance with epigenetic changes
# X chromosome 3D structure
- Inactive X chromosome forms Barr body
# X reactivation
- In precursor female germ cells both X chromosomes become active by a process of reactivation that progresses along the X genes closest to *Xist* being reactivated last
- Reactivation ensures that each haploid female germ cell contains an active X chromosome
- Immediately after fertilization, there is reactivation of the paternal X which is mostly silenced in sperm
- 2nd wave of reactivation occurs in the ICM of blastocyst stage prior to the onset of random XCI
- *XIST* becomes silent and repressive histone marks are lost in cells where reactivation occurs
- Aberrant reactivation is also observed in congenital or acquired diseases
- Persistence of *XIST/Xist* is somatic cells is not necessarily required for stable silencing
	- *Xist* deletion caused X reactivation of cancer in mice after a long period of time
- Reactivation can also be induced in iPSCs following dedifferentiation of somatic cells
	- Can easily be induced in mice by added pluripotent factors
	- Not as easy in humans, where variable patterns are observed
- Presence of 2 active X chromosomes is rarely observed in undifferentiated human ESC lines unless they are in a "naive" state
# Escape from XCI
- Mouse and human PARs contain very different sets of genes
- Genes outside the PAR can also escape SCI with significant differences in the list of escape genes btwn mouse and human
- In humans, ~15% of X-linked genes escape XCI
- In mice, ~3-7% genes escape XCI
- Escape from XCI can very between tissues and individuals
- In human SNP analyses have also shown tissue and individual variability
