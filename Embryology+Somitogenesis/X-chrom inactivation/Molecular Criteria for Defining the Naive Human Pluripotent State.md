# Introduction
# Results
## Naive Human ESCs Display a Transposon Transcription Signature of Cleavage-Stage Embryos
## Control of Transposon Transcription in Naive and Primed hESCs
## Naive Induction is Accompanied by Genome-Wide Depletion in DNA Methylation that is Reversible upon Differentiation except at imprinted DMRs
## X Chromosome Status of Female Naive ESCs Resembles the human Preimplantation Embryo
## Sensitive Mitochondrial PCR Assay Shows that Naive hESCs Rarely Contribute to Interspecies Chimeras after Morula or Blastocyst Injection
