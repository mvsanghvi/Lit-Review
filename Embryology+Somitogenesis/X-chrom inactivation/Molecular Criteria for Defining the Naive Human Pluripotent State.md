# Introduction
- Identified combination of 5 kinase inhibitors with LIF and activin A enabled conversion of pre-existing hESCs to the naïve state in the absence of transgenes

## Control of Transposon Transcription in Naïve and Primed hESCs
## Naïve Induction is Accompanied by Genome-Wide Depletion in DNA Methylation that is Reversible upon Differentiation except at imprinted DMRs
- [[Week 1]]
- Human preimplantation development is marked by global reduction in DNA methylation
- CpG methylation is a major mechanism controlling TE expression during human embryonic development
- TEs in naïve cells were hypomethylated relative to primed cells
- Overexpressed TE integrants tended to be further hypomethylated compared to non-overexpressing copies in naïve cells
- For primed cells, found that the most overexpressed groups to be hypomethylated compared to their non-primed-overexpressed counterparts
- 77% of imprinted DMRs were erased upon 4i/L/A conversion and 71% upon 5i/L/A conversion, 
	- "erased" is defined as regions where intermediate methylation in starting primed cells becomes hypomethylated in both naïve and re-primed cells
- SNPs revealed the loss of allele-specific methylation at 2 CpGs in an imprinted DMR near the SNRPN gene
- Also saw transcriptional amplification of some imprinted genes in naïve cells following the combined loss of DNA methylation, KAP1 binding, and H3K9me3 deposition
- Presence of SNP in a transcribed region of MEG3 showed that this imprinted gene was expressed from both alleles in naïve cells
- Loss of imprinted DMR methylation in naïve human cells indicates that they don't entirely recapitulate the in vivo naïve state
- Possible maintaining naïve cells in culture causes extensive demethylation events and erasure of CpG methylation in imprinted DMRs, which may not occur during the few cell divisions in cleavage embryos
## X Chromosome Status of Female Naïve ESCs Resembles the human Preimplantation Embryo
- In human preimplantation embryos, both X chromosomes are actively transcribed despite expression of *XIST*
- Conversion of female primed lines to the naïve state results in activation of *XIST*, but reduced expression of X-linked genes suggested the presence of an inactive X chromosome
- X chromosome genes maintain biallelic expression while dosage compensation proceeds during human preimplantation development
- Reporter cell line:
	- Targeted both alleles of MECP2 with GFP or tdTomato sequences fused in frame with exon 3
	- 1st clone: expressed the GFP allele in the primed state, but contained a fraction of cells with GFP and tdTomato co-expression
		- Resetting to naïve state led to uniform expression of both alleles
	- 2nd clone: expressed the tdTomato allele in the primed state
		- Resetting to naïve state also led to uniform expression of both alleles
		- Differentiation led to bias of [[X-chromosome inactivation]] to one of the MECP2 alleles over the other
			- Therefore did not undergo random X inactivation
- Used SNPs to quantify allele-specific gene expression in the reporter cells converted in 5i/L/A and maintained w or w/o GSK3 inhibition for 10 passages
	- To ensure a direct comparison between naïve and primed, analysis restricted to SNP-containing X-linked transcripts with 10+ reads in all samples
	- Starting primed cells showed a largely monoallelic expression profile at the interrogated transcripts
	- Naïve cells displayed a shift toward biallelic expression
- Total X-linked gene expression was reduced upon naïve conversion when compared to female primed cells
	- However X-linked expression also differed between male primed vs naïve, so compared male to female of each state
	- Female naïve cells had slightly increased X-linked expression
- Observation that dosage compensation is still incomplete in 5iLA provides further indication that this state may correspond most closely to the late morula or early blastocyst rather than late-blastocyst stage
	- Also suggested by transposcriptome profile
## Sensitive Mitochondrial PCR Assay Shows that Naïve hESCs Rarely Contribute to Interspecies Chimeras after Morula or Blastocyst Injection
