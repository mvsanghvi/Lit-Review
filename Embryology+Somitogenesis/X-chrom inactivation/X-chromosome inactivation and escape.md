# Introduction
# Lyon's Law
- "...suggested that this mosaic phenotype is due to inactivation of 1 or other X chromosome early in embryonic development"
- Variegated coat color is due to clonal growth of cells with random silencing of on X-chrom
- Main consequence of SCI is to equalize the dosage of X-linked gene expression (dosage compensation) btwn male and female mammals
- 2nd type of dosage compensation balances expression btwn X-linked genes and autosomal genes by upregulation of genes on the active X-chrom
- SCI also prevents overexpression of X-linked genes in female cells w 2 X-chromosomes
- Early studies in mice demonstrated evidence of 1/2ing X-linked gene expression
	- This pinpointed timing of random XCI
- Silencing of one allele is then clonally inherited in female somatic cells
# X inactivation centre and XCI initiation
- X-inactivation centre (XIC) required for the onset of XCI
- Location the XIC on the mouse and human X chrom was further defined by examining patterns of XCI in multiple additional cases of X;autosome translocations or other types of X rearrangements 
- Main key element turned out to be a gene that encodes a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) called X inactive-specific transcript (*Xist*)
- *XIST* was initially discovered in humans by singling out this lncRNA as a critical factor for SCI based on its location and being unique to female adult somatic cells
- *XIST*/*Xist* RNA coats the inactive X chromosome in *cis* and thus becomes detectable as a cloud within the nucleus of somatic cells using RNA_FISH
- Role of *Xist* and of all elements of the XIC which include several other lncRNAs and controlling elements is still under study
- In mice 2 waves of silencing, imprinted SCI is initiated on paternal X chromosome at D4
- Imprinted paternal XCI persists in extraembryonic tissues while it is followed by X reactivation in the ICM and random SCI at the blastocyst stage
- XCI depends on levels of *Xist* expression, which are controlled by its antisense *Tsix* and a series of lncRNAs located at the XIC
- The XIC also contains protein-coding genes Rnf12, whose product activates *Xist* expression based on its dosage
- Pluripotency factors (OCT4 and NANOG) control *Xist* and *Tsix* expression, preventing SCI in pluripotent cells
- In human and rabbits, SCI onset is delayed and the paternal/maternal X chromosome is randomly silenced in some cells at early stages of development
	- Thus skips the imprinted XCI observed in mice
- *Tsix* doesn't regulate *Xist* in humans 
- Initiation of XCI may be stochastic w subsequent selection cells with appropriate number of X chromosomes expressed
