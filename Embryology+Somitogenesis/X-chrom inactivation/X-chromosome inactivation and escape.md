# Introduction
# Lyon's Law
- "...suggested that this mosaic phenotype is due to inactivation of 1 or other X chromosome early in embryonic development"
- Variegated coat color is due to clonal growth of cells with random silencing of on X-chrom
- Main consequence of SCI is to equalize the dosage of X-linked gene expression (dosage compensation) btwn male and female mammals
- 2nd type of dosage compensation balances expression btwn X-linked genes and autosomal genes by upregulation of genes on the active X-chrom
- SCI also prevents overexpression of X-linked genes in female cells w 2 X-chromosomes
- Early studies in mice demonstrated evidence of 1/2ing X-linked gene expression
	- This pinpointed timing of random XCI
- Silencing of one allele is then clonally inherited in female somatic cells
