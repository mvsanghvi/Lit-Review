# Introduction
# Results
## Primed to Naive Conversion Leads to X Reactivation
## Naive hPSCs Express *XIST* from an Active X Chrosomes
## Primed to Naive Conversion Occurs via XIST-Negative XaXa Intermediate
## Xi Reactivation in Naive hESCs is Chromosome-wide 
## X-inactivation-specific De-methylation Occurs Faster than Global Hypo-methylation in the Primed to Naive Transition
## Transition from the *XIST*-Negative to *XIST*-Positive Naive State to Accompanied by Dampening of X-linked Gene Expression
## H3K27me3 Accumulates on the *XIST*-Expressing Xa in Naive Cells
## Blastocyst-Derived Naive hESCs Capture the *XIST*-Positive, but Not the *XIST*-Negative XaXa State
## Naive hESCs Induce SCI upon Differentiation
## XCI in Differentiating Naive hPSCs to Non-random
## Xi Abnormalities of Primed hESCs Are Erased in the Naive State
