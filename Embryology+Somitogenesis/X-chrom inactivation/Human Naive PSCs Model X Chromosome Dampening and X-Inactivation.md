# Introduction
# Results
## Primed to Naïve Conversion Leads to X Reactivation
## Naïve hPSCs Express *XIST* from an Active X Chromosomes
## Primed to Naïve Conversion Occurs via XIST-Negative XaXa Intermediate
## Xi Reactivation in Naïve hESCs is Chromosome-wide 
## X-inactivation-specific De-methylation Occurs Faster than Global Hypo-methylation in the Primed to Naïve Transition
## Transition from the *XIST*-Negative to *XIST*-Positive Naïve State to Accompanied by Dampening of X-linked Gene Expression
## H3K27me3 Accumulates on the *XIST*-Expressing Xa in Naïve Cells
## Blastocyst-Derived Naive hESCs Capture the *XIST*-Positive, but Not the *XIST*-Negative XaXa State
## Naive hESCs Induce SCI upon Differentiation
## XCI in Differentiating Naive hPSCs to Non-random
## Xi Abnormalities of Primed hESCs Are Erased in the Naive State
