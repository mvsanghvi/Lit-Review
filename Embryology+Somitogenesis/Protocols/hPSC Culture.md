# Introduction

![[hPSC culture timeline.jpg]]
# Human PSCs Require Conditions Distinct from Those of Murine PSCs
# Key Contributing Factors in hPSC Culture
## Growth Medium Development for hPSC Culture
- Medium has undergone dynamic evolution since initial hESC culture by Thomson in 1998
	- [[Embryonic SCs from human blastocysts]]
- 1st gen of hESC medium contained fetal bovine serum (FBS), and undefined/conditioned secretory components from MEFs
- The next generations: Replace xenogeneic elements in media used chemically defined medium with Activin A, Nodal, and FGF-2
- Feeder-based hPSC culture: Contains Knock-Out Serum Replacement  (KSR) used with FGF-2
- Feeder-free hPSC culture: Defined TeSR1 media containing FGF-2, lithium chloride (LiCl), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), TGF-beta, and pipeolic acid
	- Developed by the Thomson group [[Conditions for deriving human embryonic stem cells]]
- E8: Derivative of TeSR1 containing 8 components that lacks both serum albumin and beta-mercaptoethanol
	- Developed by the Thomson group [[Actin-myosin contractility is responsible for the reduced viability of dissociated human embryonic stem cells]]  [[Chemically defined conditions for human iPSC derivation and culture]]
