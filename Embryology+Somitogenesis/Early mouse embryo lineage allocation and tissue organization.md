- During post-implantation development of the mouse embryo [[Week 2]], descendants of the ICM in early epiblast, transit from the na√Øve to primed pluripotent state
- Used scRNA-seq with Geo-seq protocol
- Primitive streak cells at E6.5-7.0 stages were separated from E7.5 primitive streak
	- Suggests the primitive streak is temporally heterogeneous at early and late gastrulation
- [[The Hippo Pathway]] has a role in trophectoderm segregation, but is least characterized in gastrulating embryo
	- Exclusively enriched in the endoderm
	- *Tead 1, Tead4, and Ctgf* were expressed specifically in the endoderm
		- Yap1 is widely expressed
	- Therefore Hippo signaling may be involved in regulating early endoderm dev
