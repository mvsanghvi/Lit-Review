[[The Hippo Pathway]]

# Background: stem cells and organ size
# Hippo signaling in mammals
- At the core of the signaling cascade are the Sterile 20-like kinases MST1/2 and their regulatory protein WW45 (also known as SAV1), which interact to form an activated complex
- MST1/2 can also be activated by binding to the RASSF family proteins, which recruit this kinase to the cell membrane and promote its activity
- Activated MST1/2 can then directly phosphorylate the large tumor suppressor homolog kinases LATS1 and LATS2
- LATS1/2 are regulated by MOBKL1A/B (collectively MOB1) which are also phosphorylated by MST1/2 to enhance binding in the LATS1/2-MOB1 complex
- In response to high cell densities, activated LATS1/2 phosphorylates the WW-domain containing transcriptional coactivators YAP at Ser126 and TAZ as Ser89, promoting 14-3-3 binding and thereby inhibiting their translocation into the nucleus
- Uninhibited YAP/TAZ localize to the nucleus where they serve as coactivators for the TEAD-domain family member (TEAD) group of DNA-binding transcription factors
- Among many proteins postulated to be important in the initial steps of Hippo signal transduction, the only one functionally validated *in vivo* is the *Neurofibromatosis2* gene product NF2 (Merlin)

- TAZ dominantly controls the localization of SMAD2/3-4 proteins, which are transcriptional regulators that mediate TGF-beta signaling
- Stimulated TGF-beta, TAZ binds SMAD2/3-4 proteins to facilitate their nuclear accumulation and couples them to the Mediator complex, thereby promoting their transcriptional activity
- Importantly, knocking down TAZ, but not YAP, in hESCs resulted in loss of self-renewal and differentiation into neuroectoderm
	- The same phenotype seen with TGF-beta receptor inhibition

- Data indicates a model in which YAP/TAZ maintains ESC pluripotency *in vitro* by mediating BMP/TGF-beta transcriptional activity and directly promoting the expression of important stemness genes
