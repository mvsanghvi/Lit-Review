[[The Hippo Pathway]]
# Introduction: the hippo pathway basics
- However, despite the growing number of transcriptional partners, only the transcription enhancer factors (TEF/TEAD1-4) have been shown to mediate the growth promoting function of YAP so far and are considered to be the primary transcriptional partners of YAP and TAZ
# The core Hippo pathway and its extended family in mammals
## Core Hippo Pathway  components: signal transduction
## The upstream transmembrane and membrane-associated components: sensing
## Downstream transcriptional regulation: biological integration
# Hippo signaling in mammals: initial insights from mouse models
# Hippo signaling in development and embryonic stem cells
- The high level of expression of YAP and TEAD2 in embryonic stem cells, neural cells, as well as hematopoietic stem cells initially placed these genes in a general 'stemness' transcriptional signature
# Hippo signaling in mammalian stem cell compartments
## Liver
## Intestine
## Skin
## Nervous system
## Heart
## Cancer
