# Intro
- Discovery of Hippo pathway in organ size control has shed light on this mystery
# Core of the Hippo Pathway
- 1st discovered in Drosophila through genetic mosaic screens
	- Named after hpo mutant that displayed the phenotype of enormously sized organs and outwardly resemble a hippopotamus
- Core components include:
	- NDR family protein kinase LATS1/2 (or Warts (Wts) in flies)
	- Salvador SAV1 (Sav in flies) protein
	- Ste20-like protein kinase Hippo (Hpo)
	- Mob adaptor protein as tumor suppressor MOB1 (or Mats in flies)
		- All four tumor suppressors form a kinase cascade
			- Hpo-Sav complex phosphorylates and activates Wts-Mats complex
	- Transcriptional coactivator yes-associated protein (YAP) (fly ortholog is Yorkie (Yki)) was identified as an interactor of LATS1/2 
		- Controls both cell proliferation and survival
		- YAP functions opposite to LATS1/2
			- Its overexpression mimics loss of Hippo signaling
			- YAP inactivation blocks tissue overgrowth caused by Hippo inactivation
		- YAP represents major functional output of the Hippo pathway
			- Is inhibited by the Hippo kinase cascade
