# Intro
- Discovery of Hippo pathway in organ size control has shed light on this mystery
# Core of the Hippo Pathway
- 1st discovered in Drosophila through genetic mosaic screens
- Core components include:
	- Salvador (Sav) protein
	- Ste20-like protein kinase Hippo (Hpo)
	- Mob adaptor protein as tumor suppressor (Mats)
