# Intro
- Discovery of Hippo pathway in organ size control has shed light on this mystery
# Core of the Hippo Pathway
- 1st discovered in Drosophila through genetic mosaic screens
	- Named after hpo mutant that displayed the phenotype of enormously sized organs and outwardly resemble a hippopotamus
- Core components include:
	- NDR family protein kinase LATS1/2 (or Warts (Wts) in flies)
	- Salvador SAV1 (Sav in flies) protein
	- Ste20-like protein kinase Hippo (Hpo)
	- Mob adaptor protein as tumor suppressor MOB1 (or Mats in flies)
		- All four tumor suppressors form a kinase cascade
			- Hpo-Sav complex phosphorylates and activates Wts-Mats complex
	- Transcriptional coactivator yes-associated protein (YAP) (fly ortholog is Yorkie (Yki)) was identified as an interactor of LATS1/2 
		- Controls both cell proliferation and survival
		- YAP functions opposite to LATS1/2
			- Its overexpression mimics loss of Hippo signaling
			- YAP inactivation blocks tissue overgrowth caused by Hippo inactivation
		- YAP represents major functional output of the Hippo pathway
			- Is inhibited by the Hippo kinase cascade
- Phosphorylated YAP/TAZ binds 14-3-3 and is sequestered in the cytoplasm, thus inhibiting YAP/TAZ
	- Additional phosphorylation by casein kinase 1 led to beta-TrCP-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation
- In parallel to MST1/2 additional kinases can directly phosphorylate LATS1/2 at their hydrophobic motifs to activate LATS1/2
	- MAP4K1/2/3/5
	-  MAP4K4/6/7
	- TAO
		- Can also phosphorylate & activate MST1/2
- LATS1/2 and their binding partner MOB1A/B are indispensable for upstream phosphorylating/inactivating YAP/TAZ 
- Deleting MST1/2, MAP4K, or TOAK1/2/3 only partially blocks YAP/TAZ phosphorylation
	- Deleting all at once severely abolishes YAP/TAZ phosphorylation
		- Suggests redundant role for these kinases acting upstream of LATS1/2
	- Relative contribution is dependent on cell type and upstream signals
