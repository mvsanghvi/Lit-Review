## Glucose
- High glucose stimulation could induce YAP OGlcNAcylation at Thr241 by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) in a LATS-independent manner, whereby YAP protein stability and transcriptional activity were enhanced. 
- OGT-mediated YAP OGlcNAcylation could also happen at serine 109, by which LATS-YAP interaction was disrupted and YAP transcriptional activity was activated
## Hypoxia
- SIAH2, an ubiquitin E3 ligase, directed LATS2 to degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway under low oxygen, whereby YAP nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity were enhanced.
- Secretion of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) was increased under hypoxia, which in turn stabilized the ternary complexes, consisting of Zyxin, SIAH2 and LATS2, thereby facilitating SIAH2-mediated LATS degradation and reducing LATS-dependent YAP phosphorylation
## Biomechanical cues
# Transcriptional regulation of YAP/TAZ in stem cell and differentiation
- Due to the lack of any DNA-binding domain, YAP/TAZ act as a coactivator and rely on their binding to TEAD family members to mediate their transcriptional output
## Role of YAP/TAZ in the blastocyst/embryonic stem cells
### Blastocysts
- YAP-Tead4 module localized in the nuclei of outside cells at the blastocyst stage will induce *Cdx2* expression, a TE-specific transcription factor, and repress the expression of ICM-specific pluripotency genes, such as *Oct4* and *Nanog*, thereby promoting TE specification.
- While in inner cells, Yap is phosphorylated and sequestered in cytoplasm due to the cell-contact inhibition, whereby its transcriptional activity is repressed.
- During epiblast formation process from ICM, high YAP-TEAD activity is required for the strong expressions of pluripotency factors and the induction of an epiblast with naive pluripotency.
### Embryonic stem cells (ESCs)
- YAP1/Tead4 could complex with p300 to activated anti-apoptotic genes, and repress pro-apoptotic genes during *in vitro* ESC differentiation, thereby safeguarding ESCs from excessive apoptosis. 
- Beyer et al. discovered that TAZ/YAP/TEAD, SMAD2/3 and OCT4 (TSO) collaborated with NuRD repressor complexes to buffer pluripotency gene while suppressing mesoderm gene expression in human ESCs. 
## Role of YAP/TAZ in adult stem cells
### Neural stem cells (NSCs)
- BMP-SMAD pathway has emerged as critical regulators of NSC self-renewal and differentiation
- BMP2 treatment could inhibit mouse NSC proliferation, through reduction of YAP nuclear translocation, YAP/TEAD interaction, and YAP/TEAD-induced Cyclin D1 expression.
- Mechanistically, Smad1/4, the effectors of BMP2 signaling, competed with YAP for the interaction with TEAD1
- The Pax family member Pax3 could recruit Yap/Taz at the promoter regions to synergistically activate melanocyte gene expression, such as *Mitf*, and which was independent of Tead family factors, demonstrating a Pax3-dependent role fo Yap/Taz in neural crest cell specification
### Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and skeletal stem cells (SSCs)
- Transcription factor AP2a could compete with RUNX2 to bind YAP, thereby releasing the inhibition of YAP to RUNX2 by forming a YAP-AP2a protein complex in MSCs
- YAP/AP2a complex subsequently moved to *BARX1* promoter region and inhibited its transcription, thereby enhancing the MSC-induced osteogenic differentiation

### Pancreatic and hepatic progenitors
