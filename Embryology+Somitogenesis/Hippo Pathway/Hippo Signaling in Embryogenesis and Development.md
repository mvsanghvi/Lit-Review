# Hippo Pathway and its Role in Organ size Control
- [[The Hippo Pathway]] is highly conserved in mammals and controls development and tissue/organ homeostasis
- Core components include a kinase cascade and a transcription module
- Cascade functions to inhibit the transcription module that represents the major functional output of the Hippo pathway thereby inhibiting cell/tissue growth
- Hippo pathway responds to diverse signals to control cell growth, differentiation, tissue/organ development, and homeostasis:
	1. Hormones
	2. Cell-cell/cell-matrix contract
	3. Mechanic cues
	4. Cellular energy status
	5. various stress
- This review has an emphasis on mouse genetic studies
# Core Components of the Hippo Pathway
- Consist of a kinase cascade and downstream transcription effectors:
	1. Mammalian STE20 like kinase 1/2 (MST1/2)
	2. Mitogen activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase (MAP4K) family
	3. Large tumor suppressor kinase 1/2 (LATS1/2)
	4. Yes associated protein 1 (YAP1)
	5. WW domain containing transcription regulator 1 (WWTR1/TAZ)
	6. DNA-binding protein TEA domain transcription factor 1/2/3/4 (TEAD1/2/3/4)
- At the top of the kinase cascade: PP2A in the striatin interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complexes
	- Limits MST1/2 or MAP4K activity by direct dephosphorylation
- When stimulated by upstream signals, STRIPAK-mediated dephosphorylation is relieved, thereby MST1/2 and MAP4K are phosphorylated and activated
	- Possibly due to autophosphorylation or by the upstream TAO kinase
- Salvador family WW domain containing protein 1 (SAV1) and MOB kinase activator (MOB1A/B) are phosphorylated by active MST1/2 and recruit LATS1/2 for activation by MST
- Besides MST1/2, MAP4K proteins can also phosphorylate and activate LATS1/2
- Neurofibromin 2 (NF2) is a critical upstream regulator that promotes the activation of Hippo by interacting with upstream signals and Hippo components
- YAP/TAZ is phosphorylated by LATS1/2, resulting in binding with 14-3-3 and cytoplasmic sequestration
- LATS1/2 phosphorylated YAP/TAZ can undergo further phosphorylation by casein kinase 1δ/ε 
	- This phosphorylation recruits SCF E3 ligase, leading to protein ubiquitination and degradation
- YAPT/TAZ doesn't have any DNA binding domain and act as a coactivator
- Output of Hippo is mainly dependent on their binding to TEAD family members, which share a highly conserved DNA binding domain and a YAP/TAZ binding domain
- One unique feature of TEAD is that it can be auto-palmitoylated and this palmitoylation is critical for TEAD function
- In the absence of YAP/TAZ, TEAD interacts with vestigial like family member 4 (VGLL4) a protein containing Vg motif with transcriptional repression activity, to form a default repression complex
