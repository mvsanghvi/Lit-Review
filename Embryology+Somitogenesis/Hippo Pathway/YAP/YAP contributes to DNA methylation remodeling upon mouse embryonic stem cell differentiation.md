# Intro
- [[YAP]]/Taz double KO lead to embryos arrested in the pre-morula stage
	- Likely due to induced repression of Sox2
		- Thus preventing appearance of ICM phenotype
- YAP is expressed in the blastocyst and in ESCs
- Many studies looked to characterize the function of YAP/TAZ in ESCs
	- Some reported YAP or TAZ suppression leads to decreased intensity of alkaline phosphatase staining in colonies, downregulation of Oct4 and Sox2, and concomitant expression of differentiation markers like T, Gata4, and alpha-fetoprotein
	- Overexpression of TEAD dom-neg protein led to inducing ESCs inducing differentiation preferentially to the endodermal lineage
	- High TEAD activity sustains pluripotency in ICM
	- Low TEAD levels cells are eliminated
	- Conflicting results showed that YAP/TAZ depletion had no effects on stemness when ESCs are grown in 2i media
		- Instead, downregulation mimics GSK3 inhibition that blocks beta-catenin pathway
	- Silencing/KO of YAP does not effect maintaining the undifferentiated state
	- When differentiation, YAP knockdown (KD) results in insufficient accumulation of differentiation markers, including T, Gata6, and Gata3
		- Oct4 and Nanog are normally suppressed
# Transient KD of YAP affects early steps of differentiation of ESCs
- GFP-expressing ESCs under control of neural-specific promoter (alpha1-tubulin gene)
- YAP KD cells were induced to differentiate towards neuroectodermal fate
- Number of GFP-positive cells significantly decreased in YAP KD since first step of differentiation 
# Transient KD of YAP causes perturbation of homeostasis ESCs
- Surviving cells seem to be unable to differentiate properly
	- Suggests that the transient down-regulation of YAP stably affect the signature of selected sub-populations of surviving cells
