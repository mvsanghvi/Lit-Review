# Intro
- YAP is a transcription coactivator with a potent transactivation domain in the C-terminal region
- The N-terminal region of YAP is responsible for interaction with TEAD transcription factors
- One or two WW domains in the central region of YAP, depending on alternative splicing. The WW domains of YAP have been well characterized to bind the PPXY motif
# Results
- Reduced TAZ activity leads to neuronal differentiation of human ES cells
# Discussion
