# Introduction
[[YAP]] represses mesoendodermal (ME) differentiation in hESCs by regulating the activity of the Nodal and WNT3 pathways
# Results
## YAP1 is required for cell-fate patterning of hESC-derived 2D gastruloids
- 2D gastruloids [[Week 3]] lead to ring formations
- % of mesoderm (BRACHYURY/T+) and endoderm (SOX17+) marker positive cells was higher in the YAP1-deleted micropatterns. 
	- Hence, YAP1 KO gastruloids displayed expanded mesoderm and endoderm rings that populated the center of the colony
- YAP1 KO gastruloids retained higher levels of OCT4 compared with WT, which is necessary to specify ME lineages
## YAP1 KO hESCs fail to differentiate into ectoderm
## YAP1 represses Nodal pathway genes during ectoderm differentiation
## YAP1 regulates the chromatin accessibility of _FOXH1_ and _NODAL_ developmental genes

## Cytoplasmic retention of SMAD2/3 during ectoderm induction depends on YAP1
