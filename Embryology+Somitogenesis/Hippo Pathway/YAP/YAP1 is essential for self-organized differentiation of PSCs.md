# Introduction
- NODAL is one of the main ligands of the TGF-β pathway
	- Cytokine involved in regulation of primed pluripotency, proliferation, and early differentiation 
	- Signals through mediator proteins of the SMAD family
- Pluripotency markers and TGF-β upregulated in cells on the outer rim of colonies, especially NODAL and LEFTY1 
	- LEFTY1 is NODAL inhibitor (left-right determination factor 1)
- NODAL is most likely regulated by [[YAP]]/TAZ
# Results
## YAP1 deficiency induces transcriptomic and epigenetic modulation in human iPSCs
## YAP -/- iPSC colonies self-organize in 2D
## YAP1 deficiency enhances directed endodermal differentiation
## YAP1 is required for early differentiation towards germ layers in embryoid bodies
## YAP1 modulates TGF-Beta signaling in undirected differentiation
# Conclusion
