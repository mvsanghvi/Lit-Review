# Introduction
- NODAL is one of the main ligands of the TGF-β pathway
	- Cytokine involved in regulation of primed pluripotency, proliferation, and early differentiation 
	- Signals through mediator proteins of the SMAD family
- Pluripotency markers and TGF-β upregulated in cells on the outer rim of colonies, especially NODAL and LEFTY1 
	- LEFTY1 is NODAL inhibitor (left-right determination factor 1)
- NODAL is most likely regulated by [[YAP]]/TAZ
- YAP1 is also an essential mechanotransducer independent from Hippo cascade, where nuclear translocation occurs in response to substrate elasticity and cell shape 
- YAP1 loss causes arrest of mouse embryo development at E8.5
	- Defective yolk sac vasculogenesis, chorioallontic attachment, and embryonic axis elongation
- YAP1 is important for gem cell differentiation from mEpiSC
- YAP1 represses mesendodermal differentiation in hESCs by regulating NODAL and WNT3 pathway
- YAP1 KO iPSCs revealed changes in gene expression and DNAm during ectoderm and endoderm differentiation
- KO still maintains trilineage differentiation
- KOs EB had low GATA6, T, and PAX6 upregulation 
	- Rescued by both lentiviral overexpression of YAP1 and NODAL inhibitors
# Results
## YAP1 deficiency induces transcriptomic and epigenetic modulation in human iPSCs
## YAP -/- iPSC colonies self-organize in 2D
## YAP1 deficiency enhances directed endodermal differentiation
## YAP1 is required for early differentiation towards germ layers in embryoid bodies
## YAP1 modulates TGF-Beta signaling in undirected differentiation
# Conclusion
