# Introduction
- NODAL is one of the main ligands of the WNT pathwa
- NODAL is most likely regulated by [[YAP]]/TAZ
# Results
## YAP1 deficiency induces transcriptomic and epigenetic modulation in human iPSCs
## YAP -/- iPSC colonies self-organize in 2D
## YAP1 deficiency enhances directed endodermal differentiation
## YAP1 is required for early differentiation towards germ layers in embryoid bodies
## YAP1 modulates TGF-Beta signaling in undirected differentiation
# Conclusion
