# Introduction
- NODAL is one of the main ligands of the TGF-β pathway
	- Cytokine involved in regulation of primed pluripotency, proliferation, and early differentiation 
	- Signals through mediator proteins of the SMAD family
- Pluripotency markers and TGF-β upregulated in cells on the outer rim of colonies, especially NODAL and LEFTY1 
	- LEFTY1 is NODAL inhibitor (left-right determination factor 1)
- NODAL is most likely regulated by [[YAP]]/TAZ
- YAP1 is also an essential mechanotransducer independent from Hippo cascade, where nuclear translocation occurs in response to substrate elasticity and cell shape 
- YAP1 loss causes arrest of mouse embryo development at E8.5
	- Defective yolk sac vasculogenesis, chorioallontic attachment, and embryonic axis elongation
- YAP1 is important for germ cell differentiation from mEpiSC
- YAP1 represses mesendodermal differentiation in hESCs by regulating NODAL and WNT3 pathway
- YAP1 KO iPSCs revealed changes in gene expression and DNAm during ectoderm and endoderm differentiation
- KO still maintains trilineage differentiation
- KOs EB had low GATA6, T, and PAX6 upregulation 
	- Rescued by both lentiviral overexpression of YAP1 and NODAL inhibitors
# Results
## YAP1 deficiency induces transcriptomic and epigenetic modulation in human iPSCs
- Differential expression in YAP1 deficient of 2511 YAP1 targets compared to WT cells
- Mesoderm related YAP1 target genes were upregulated in YAP KO cells vs WT
	- HEY2 and RBM47
- WNT pathway genes downregulated while NODAL was upregulated in YAP KO cells
## YAP -/- iPSC colonies self-organize in 2D
- YAP1 activity was modulated upon BMP4 stimulation
	- [[Surface topography guides morphology and spatial patterning of iPSC colonies]]
- YAP KO  had the same elongation as WT
- YAP1 doesn't pay a central role for this response to substrate structures.
- YAP1 isn't a key regulator for self organization of 2D pluripotent stem cell colonies
## YAP1 deficiency enhances directed endodermal differentiation
- Mesoderm was separated by 1st dimension of DNAm clustering while WT and YAP KO were separated in the 2nd
	- DNAm changes of mesodermal differentiation similar between YAP KO and WT
- Strongest differences in hyper and hypo-methylated CpGs after mesodermal differentiation
## YAP1 is required for early differentiation towards germ layers in embryoid bodies
- Viability of EBs wasn't reduced due to YAP1 KO
- EBs from YAP KO kept high OCT4 expression and didn't upregulate germ layer markers
- To exclude possibility of differentiation potential due to cell damage, rescued with YAP1 with lentiviral transfection
- Lentiviral transfection did NOT rescue T expression
## YAP1 modulates TGF-Beta signaling in undirected differentiation
- Nodal and LEFTY1 upregulated in YAP KO
- Pluripotency marker gene expression was higher in YAP KO EBs 
- 3 germ layers were barely expressed in YAP KO EBs
- TGF-β inhibition in YAP KO led to moderate upregulation of T
- Mesoderm related CpGs were barely affected by YAP KO EBs
