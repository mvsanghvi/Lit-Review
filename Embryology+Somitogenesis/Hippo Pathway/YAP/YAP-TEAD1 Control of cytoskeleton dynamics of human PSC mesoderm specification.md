YAP–TEAD1 control of cytoskeleton dynamics and intracellular tension guides human pluripotent stem cell mesoderm specification

- hESCs and iPSCs grow in compact colonies at high cell density; while this condition is usually associated in somatic epithelial cells to YAP inactivation and nuclear exclusion, YAP remains predominantly expressed in PSC nuclei.
- YAP intracellular localization was largely independent on the position of the cell within the iPSC colony
- PSCs show a sustained activation of YAP, raising the question of what is its function in this context

## YAP–TEAD1-guided cytoskeleton remodelling is needed for mesoderm specification

- YAP mutant cells were more prone to acquire mesoderm and endoderm markers as compared to their isogenic counterpart when appropriately stimulated
