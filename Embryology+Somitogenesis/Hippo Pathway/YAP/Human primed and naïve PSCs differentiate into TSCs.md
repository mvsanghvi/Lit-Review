# Introduction
# Results
## Derivation of TSC lines from primed hPSCs
## pdTSC lines share a transcriptional profile and chromatin configuration with other TSC lines
## pdTSCs can differentiate into the main trophoblast lineages and form lesions upon injection into non-obese diabetic (NOD)-severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice
## Huma naïve PSCs are not more susceptible to generating TSCs than primed hPSCs
## Inclusion of GSK3i derails human primed PSCs away from the TSC lineage
## Nuclear YAP is necessary and sufficient for conversion of human PSCs into TSCs
- Induced nuclear localization of the YAP cofactor TEAD4 is sufficient to convert mouse naïve ESCs into TSCs

- YAP overexpression can induce TSCs from primed hPSCs
- WIBR3 YAP KO had retarded growth after 5 days in TI medium
