Transcription factor of the [[The Hippo Pathway]]

Self-Summary:
- YAP/TAZ accumulation in the nucleus under: 
	- Stiff surfaces such as Matrigel and collagen I
	- Low density
- YAP/TAZ stays in the cytoplasm:
	- Soft surfaces
	- High density
	- [[YAP and PDZ Binding for control of hPSC Self-renewal and differentiation]]

Mouse Cells:
- Mouse PSM cells:
	- Cells infected with YAP5SA constitutively active YAP1 lentiviral construct
		- In combination with LatA treatment, no oscillations observed
		- Without LatA treatment, still saw oscillations in YAP5SA
	- Cells cultured on fibronectin resulted in preferential nuclear localization of YAP1
		- YAP1 localized in both nucleus and cytoplasm when same cells cultured on BSA
		- Increasing cell density overcame fibronectin's effect on YAP activation 
			- AKA, less translocation to nucleus with increased cell density

Human Cells:
- hESCs and iPSCs grow in compact colonies at high cell density
	- Usually associated in somatic epithelial cells to YAP inactivation and nuclear exclusion **BUT** YAP remains predominantly expressed in PSC nuclei.
