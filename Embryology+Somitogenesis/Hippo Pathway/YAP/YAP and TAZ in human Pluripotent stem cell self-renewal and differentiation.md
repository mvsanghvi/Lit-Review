# Introduction
- hESCs are commonly derived from the ICM of preimplantation embryos and can maintain their pluripotency in appropriate culture media
- Mouse epiblast stem cells (the primed pluripotent state) have similar properties with hESCs (the naive pluripotent state)
## The Hippo signaling pathway
- Canonical Hippo Signaling include two serine-threonine kinase, MST1/2 (mammalian Ste20-like kinases 1/2) and the MAP4K family of kinases that stimulate LATS1/2 (large tumor suppressor 1/2)
- The Hippo pathway acts by binding MST1/2 to the SAV1 (Salvador homolog 1) as a regulatory protein and MOB1 (MOB kinase activator 1A) activator
- The Hippo kinase by promoting the cytoplasmic accumulation of YAP and TAZ negatively controls their activity
- NF2 (neurofibromatosis type 2) with the MST/SAV complex enhances the LATS1/2 phosphorylation
- Subsequently, the activated LATS1/2 promotes the formation of phosphorylated YAP and TAZ in the cytoplasm by interaction with alpha-catenin and 14-3-3 protein
- There were several domains and motifs including the WW domains, the TEAD (TEA domain family member 1) TF-binding domain, the SH3-binding domain, the CC (coiled-coil) domain, the TAD domain, and PDZ-binding motif within YAP and TAZ
- Activated YAP and TAZ translocate into the nucleus to bind the TEAD1-4 TF
	- In the nucleus, several other TFs can interact with YAP/TAZ
		- SMAD, RUNX2, TBX5, and ERBB4
- TEAD then stimulates cell proliferation, survival, migration, and antiapoptotic-related genes 
	- I.e. *CTGF, CYR61, and ITGB2*
- Accumulation of YAP/TAZ in the nucleus under stiff surfaces such as Matrigel
	- Also collagen I
- Under soft surfaces YAP/TAZ stays in the cytoplasm
## YAP/TAZ signals can regulate hESC self-renewal and differentiation
