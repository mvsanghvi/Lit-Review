# Intro
- Difference in self-renewal requirements for mouse ESCs and human naïve PSCs may be due to differing lineage potency
- Both require MEK/ERK inhibition to sustain the naïve state and stop progression to formative pluripotent state
- Human naïve PSCs can also differentiate into trophectoderm (TE)
	- Mouse ESCs can't
	- XAV939 suppresses TE
		- Normally known as a WNT inhibitor
- Tankyrases (as part of WNT) adds poly-ADP-ribose to proteins
	- Leading to elimination by ubiquitin proteasome pathway
	- Also targets angiomotin (AMOT)
- AMOT proteins are part of the Hippo/[[Yap]] pathway
	- Promotes kinase activity of LATS1/2
	- Attenuates YAP protein nuclear translocation
	- Stabilizing AMOT= reduces YAP activity
# Discussion
- In human naïve PSCs
	- XAV939 related to suppression of TE
	- Removing XAV939 led to expression of TE markers
		- WNT targets *TBXT* and *MIXL1* are upregulated only when cells are also released from MEK/ERK inhibition
## XAV939 withdrawal leads to decreased AMOTL2 and upregulation of YAP1/TAZ targets
- AMOT and AMOTL2 prevents YAP nuclear localization in early mouse embryos
	- Disable TEAD-mediated transcription of TE genes in the ICM
	- AMOTL2 mRNA is most abundant in naïve PSCs
		- Also in ICM and naïve epiblast of the human embryo
