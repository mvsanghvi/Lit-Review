# Intro
- Difference in self-renewal requirements for mouse ESCs and human naïve PSCs may be due to differing lineage potency
- Both require MEK/ERK inhibition to sustain the naïve state and stop progression to formative pluripotent state
- Human naïve PSCs can also differentiate into trophectoderm (TE)
	- Mouse ESCs can't
	- XAV939 suppresses TE
		- Normally known as a WNT inhibitor
- Tankyrases (as part of WNT) adds poly-ADP-ribose to proteins
	- Leading to elimination by ubiquitin proteasome pathway
	- Also targets angiomotin (AMOT)
- AMOT proteins are part of the Hippo/[[Yap]] pathway
	- Promotes kinase activity of LATS1/2
	- Attenuates YAP protein nuclear translocation
	- Stabilizing AMOT= reduces YAP activity
# Discussion
- In human naïve PSCs
	- XAV939 related to suppression of TE
	- Removing XAV939 led to expression of TE markers
		- WNT targets *TBXT* and *MIXL1* are upregulated only when cells are also released from MEK/ERK inhibition
## XAV939 withdrawal leads to decreased AMOTL2 and upregulation of YAP1/TAZ targets
- AMOT and AMOTL2 prevents YAP nuclear localization in early mouse embryos
	- In mouse ICM, AMOT required for YAP1 phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion
	- Disable TEAD-mediated transcription of TE genes in the ICM
	- AMOTL2 mRNA is most abundant in naïve PSCs
		- Also in ICM and naïve epiblast of the human embryo
- Plating w/o XAV= reduced AMOTL2 lvls
- nPSCs cultured w/o XAV= reduction of YAP1 phosphorylation at Ser127 site
- Usually, heterogenous nucleocytoplasmic staining of YAP1 in nPSCs
	- XAV withdrawal for 24 hrs led to significant moderate increase in nuclear staining
		- Effect more pronounced for TAZ
- Panel of YAP/TEAD targets were upregulated in nPSCs 24hrs post WAV withdrawal
- **Meaning, withdrawal of tankyrase inhibition in nPSCs leads to increased YAP nuclearization and TEAD transcriptional program activation**
## Depletion of YAP1 enables sustained self-renewal w/o XAV939
- YAP1 5SA expression led to marked upregulation of GATA:mK02 reporter expression and TE genes in PXGL
- Constitutive YAP activity overrides the ability of tankyrase inhibition to suppress TE.
- Deletion of YAP1 or TAZ in naive cells
	- Shows markedly reduced frequency of GATA3:mK02 induction when transferred to PD03
		- Meaning they survive though
	- Double KOs do **NOT** expand
	- YAP1 KO showed minimal GATA3:mK02 induction while retaining expression of OCT4 and naïve marker KLF17
- Does YAP1 KO enable efficient self-renewal w/o need for XAV?
	- Results showed YAP activation mediates human nPSC to TE differentiation while XAV suppresses this signal
