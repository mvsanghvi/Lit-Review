# Intro
- Difference in self-renewal requirements for mouse ESCs and human naïve PSCs may be due to differing lineage potency
- Both require MEK/ERK inhibition to sustain the naïve state and stop progression to formative pluripotent state
- Human naive PSCs can also differentiate into trophectoderm (TE)
	- Mouse ESCs can't
	- XAV939 suppresses TE
		- Normally known as a WNT inhibitor
- Tankyrases (as part of WNT) adds poly-ADP-ribose to proteins
	- Leading to elimination by ubiquitin proteasome pathway
	- Also targets angiomotin (AMOT)
- AMOT proteins are part of the Hippo/[[Yap]] pathway
