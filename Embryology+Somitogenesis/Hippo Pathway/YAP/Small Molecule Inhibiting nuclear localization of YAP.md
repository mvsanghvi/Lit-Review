Small Molecule inhibiting the nuclear localization of YAP/TAZ for chemotherapeutics and chemosensitizers against breast cancers
Uehara et al 2015

- In MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, screened small molecules targeting YAP/TAZ:
- Those that inhibited nuclear localization of YAP:
	- Thiazovivin
	- Dasatinib
		- Inhibits SCR
		- Changes actin dynamics, which leads to YAP/TAZ phosphorylation
	- Lovastatin
		- Rhoa dependent inactivation of YAP/TAZ
			- Inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, thus leading to impaired geranylgeranylation of RHOA
				- Adding geranylgeranyl diphosphate in conjunction with fluvastatin rescued YAP function, thus cancelling out the effect of fluvastatin
		- Changes actin dynamics
	- Cucurbitacin I
	- Pazopanib
		- Dasatinib, statin, and pazopanib are clinical approved drugs
			- **Effect of pazopanib was the weakest of the three**
