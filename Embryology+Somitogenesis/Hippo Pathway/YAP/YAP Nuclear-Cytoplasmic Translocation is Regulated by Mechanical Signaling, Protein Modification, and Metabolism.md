# Intro
- Interestingly,  [[YAP]]  distribution  between  thenucleus and cytoplasm is not static (Manning et al., 2018)
# The structural basis of cell nuclear transport process
# Mechanical signals that regulate YAP nuclear import
- YAP is one of the most sensitive transcription factors(TFs) activated in response to mechanical stress. 
- Pharmacological factors and altered extracellular matrix stiffness can regulate YAP nuclear localization by altering cell contractility
- Studies have indicated that, in the absence of cell–cell contact, actin contraction inhibits YAP phosphorylation at Ser
- Surprisingly, YAP nuclear transport will still occur even if actin does not contract
- Changes of actin cytoskeletal integrity seem more critical for YAP nuclear localization, as this stimulus can override YAP regulation by phosphorylation or actin contraction
- YAP and TAZ are homologs, and are the mammalian
- TAZ is a transcriptional factor that contains a 14‐3‐3 binding motif, a single WW domain, and a PDZ binding motif. 14‐3‐3 is a eukaryotic adaptor protein that: 
	- binds to other proteins to assist with protein folding
	- regulate protein localization
	- stimulate or inhibit other protein–protein interactions
