# Introduction
- hESCs are commonly derived from the ICM of preimplantation embryos and can maintain their pluripotency in appropriate culture media
- Mouse epiblast stem cells (the primed pluripotent state) have similar properties with hESCs (the naive pluripotent state)
- hESCs and mEpiSCs self-renew through dividing asymmetrically with activating TGF-beta and basic FGF
	- Can differentiate when stimulated with proper sets of internal and external signals
## The Hippo signaling pathway
- Canonical Hippo Signaling include two serine-threonine kinase, MST1/2 (mammalian Ste20-like kinases 1/2) and the MAP4K family of kinases that stimulate LATS1/2 (large tumor suppressor 1/2)
- The Hippo pathway acts by binding MST1/2 to the SAV1 (Salvador homolog 1) as a regulatory protein and MOB1 (MOB kinase activator 1A) activator
- The Hippo kinase by promoting the cytoplasmic accumulation of [[YAP]] and TAZ negatively controls their activity
- NF2 (neurofibromatosis type 2) with the MST/SAV complex enhances the LATS1/2 phosphorylation
- Subsequently, the activated LATS1/2 promotes the formation of phosphorylated YAP and TAZ in the cytoplasm by interaction with alpha-catenin and 14-3-3 protein
- There were several domains and motifs including the WW domains, the TEAD (TEA domain family member 1) TF-binding domain, the SH3-binding domain, the CC (coiled-coil) domain, the TAD domain, and PDZ-binding motif within YAP and TAZ
- Activated YAP and TAZ translocate into the nucleus to bind the TEAD1-4 TF
	- In the nucleus, several other TFs can interact with YAP/TAZ
		- SMAD, RUNX2, TBX5, and ERBB4
- TEAD then stimulates cell proliferation, survival, migration, and antiapoptotic-related genes 
	- I.e. *CTGF, CYR61, and ITGB2*
- YAP/TAZ accumulation in the nucleus under: 
	- Stiff surfaces such as Matrigel and collagen I
	- Low density
- YAP/TAZ stays in the cytoplasm:
	- Soft surfaces
	- High density
- YAP/TAZ nuclear accumulation is inhibited by Rho GTPases (Rho-associated kinase) inhibitor Y27632 and ML-7 (myosin light chain kinase inhibitor) 
## YAP/TAZ signals can regulate hESC self-renewal and differentiation
- YAP is a potent transcription coactivator by binding to the TEAD plays an essential role in regulating hESC fate decisions
- Has been found that during hESC differentiation, LATS inhibits YAP protein, and leads to loss of embryonic stem cell pluripotency
	- [[The role of YAP transcription coactivator in regulating stem cell self-renewal and differentiation]]
- WNT and Hippo pathways can regulate the expression of pluripotency factor OCT4
- Also been found that Hippo/YAP signaling through the interactions with Wnt signaling can control neural tissue patterning of hPSCs
	- [[Wnt-YAP interactions in the neural fate of human pluripotent stem cells and the implications for neural organoid formation]]
	- Low-density culture conditions as a modulator of Hippo pathway activity increase nuclear YAP expression, and changed neural cell fate

- YAP-TEAD complexes can activate Oct4 expression and improve hPSC proliferation
