- Blocking the retinoic acid pathway + adding RocI Y-27632 improved cell viability and oscillation stability
## Mechanism Cues and YAP signaling Control the Oscillatory Transition
- Substituting fibronectin by BSA for coating substrate restored sustained oscillations of [[Somitogenesis and Segmentation]] in single cells with DLL1 absence
	- Fibronectin (an other adhesion substrates) modulate [[YAP]] signaling
- Cells cultured on fibronectin resulted in preferential nuclear localization of YAP1
	- YAP1 localized in both nucleus and cytoplasm when same cells cultured on BSA
- Cells were then cultured on fibronectin with latrunculin A (LatA)
	- LatA= Actin polymerization inhibitor which disrupts microfilament organization
	- Led to downregulation of *Ankrd1*, *Cyr61*, and *Ctgf*
- Cells infected with YAP5SA constitutively active YAP1 lentiviral construct
	- In combination with LatA treatment, no oscillations observed
	- Without LatA treatment, still saw oscillations in YAP5SA
- Tail bud explants cultured on fibronectin
	- YAP targets were downregulated compared to isolated cells in same conditions
	- YAP found in both nucleus and cytoplasm
		- Posterior PSM in mouse embryos
- Increasing cell density overcame fibronectin's effect on YAP activation
- Inverse correlation between the nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio of YAP1 and cell density
	- Found through micropattern seeded at different cell densities
