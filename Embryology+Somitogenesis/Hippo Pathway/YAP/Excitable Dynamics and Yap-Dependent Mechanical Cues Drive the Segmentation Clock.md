- Blocking the retinoic acid pathway + adding RocI Y-27632 improved cell viability and oscillation stability
## Mechanism Cues and YAP signaling Control the Oscillatory Transition
- Substituting fibronectin by BSA for coating substrate restored sustained oscillations of [[Somitogenesis and Segmentation]] in single cells with DLL1 absence
	- Fibronectin (an other adhesion substrates) modulate [[YAP]] signaling
- Cells cultured on fibronectin resulted in preferential nuclear localization of YAP1
	- YAP1 localized in both nucleus and cytoplasm when same cells cultured on BSA
