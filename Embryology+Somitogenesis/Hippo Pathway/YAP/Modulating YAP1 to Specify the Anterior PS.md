Specifying the Anterior Primitive Streak by modulating [[YAP]]1 levels in hPSCs
[[Week 2]]

# Introduction
# Results
## Transient Inhibition of YAP1 Induces hESC Differentiation along the Anterior PS Cell Fate
## YAP1 Does Not regulate Differentiation to Posterior PS Cell Fate
## ACTIVIN + Dasatinib (YAP1i)-Derived PS Cells Can Differentiate along the Endoderm and Cardiac Cell Lingeages

## PS Progenitors Can Be Reprogrammed
## ACTIVIN + YAP1i Treatment Provides an Alternative Strategy for Cardiac Induction

# Conclusions
