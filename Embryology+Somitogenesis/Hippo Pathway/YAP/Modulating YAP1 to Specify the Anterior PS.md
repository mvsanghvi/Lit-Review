Specifying the Anterior Primitive Streak by modulating [[YAP]]1 levels in hPSCs
[[Week 2]]

# Introduction
- Cells from APS (anterior PS) become endoderm (Sox17+) and cardiac mesoderm
	- ACTIVIN directs APS towards endoderm
- Cells from PPS (posterior PS) populate extraembryonic and somitic mesoderm
	- ACTIVIN represses PPS gene CDX2
	- CDX2, MSGN1, and TBX6 are WNT targets
- YAP1 strongly regulates WNT and ACTIVIN signaling hESCs
- YAP/TEAD complex binds to WNT3 and NODAL to block expression of WNT/ACTIVIN coinduced pan-PS genes
	- I.e. T, MIXL1, and EOMES
- YAP KO cells differentiate along the cardiac lineage in response to ACTIVIN
	- [[YAP leads to cardiac mesoderm lineage]]
# Results
## Transient Inhibition of YAP1 Induces hESC Differentiation along the Anterior PS Cell Fate
- 24hr treatment of dasatinib led to dose-dependent reduction of YAP protein levels 
- Dasatinib combined with Activin led to increased expression of MIXL1, EOMES, and T
	- Similar to levels as YAP KO with Activin
- Activin treatment of YAP KO cells led to increased expression of pan and APS markers vs WT
- Sox17 mRNA abundance increased nearly 8 fold in Activin+dasatinib treated cells
## YAP1 Does Not regulate Differentiation to Posterior PS Cell Fate
- - YAP KO had same downregulation of pan, A, and PPS markers as WT
	- Including T, MSGN1, and CDX2
- Loss of YAP1 treated with GSK3i did not significantly affect the induction of the PPS genes
## ACTIVIN + Dasatinib (YAP1i)-Derived PS Cells Can Differentiate along the Endoderm and Cardiac Cell Lingeages

## PS Progenitors Can Be Reprogrammed
## ACTIVIN + YAP1i Treatment Provides an Alternative Strategy for Cardiac Induction
