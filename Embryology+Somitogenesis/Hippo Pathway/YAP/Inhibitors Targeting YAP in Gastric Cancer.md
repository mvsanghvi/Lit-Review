Inhibitors Targeting [[YAP]] in Gastric Cancer: Current Status and Future Perspectives
Yong et al. 2021

# Statins
- From 640 clinically used drugs, they found that statins have the most potent inhibitory effect on YAP
- Cerivastatin and other drugs regulating the mevalonate (MVA) pathway inhibited the mevalonate pathway 
	- Caused a marked accumulation of YAP/ TAZ in the cytoplasm of multiple cell lines
- Simvastatin increased LATS1 and phosphorylated YAP (S127) protein levels
	- inhibitory effect on YAP may be achieved by inhibiting the activity of Rho through the MVA pathway
- Rho can inhibit the phosphorylation of YAP through LATS1/2
# Src Inhibitors
- Dasatinib effectively targeted the proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src
	- Is a small molecule multi-target kinase inhibitor approved by the FDA for the first-line treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia
- In renal cell carcinoma: 
	- Demonstrated that, by inhibiting the Src-LATS path-way, inhibiting YAP activity significantly:
		- up-regulated YAP phosphorylation
			- promoting YAP retention in the cytoplasm
				- Reducing YAP-TEAD binding
					- Further weakening the transcriptional activity of YAP
