# Intro
# Results
## YAP prevents hESC differentiation in response to Activin signaling
## β-Catenin is required for Activin-induced differentiation of YAP knockout hESCs
## Activin induces genome-wide recruitment of β-catenin to chromatin in YAP knockout cells
## YAP represses the _WNT3_ and _NODAL_ enhancers in hESCs
## _WNT3_ activation is essential for Activin-induced differentiation in YAP knockout cells
## YAP prevents SMAD2,3 binding to the _WNT3_ promoter and counteracts transcription elongation
## Activin-treated YAP knockout cells induce the cardiac mesoderm program
## Cardiac inhibitors MSX1 and CDX2 are not induced in Activin-treated YAP knockout cells
## Activin-induced Smad2,3 counteract β-catenin activity on the CDX2 gene
## Activin-treated YAP knockout hESCs progress toward cardiomyocytes
## YAP does not block intermediate stages of cardiomyogenesis
