# Intro
- Wnt and Activin signals cooperate to induce key mesendodermal (ME) differentiation genes needed to form the prim streak (PS), mesoderm, and endoderm layers
- Activin signaling maintains pluripotency in self renewing hESCs by activating NANOG expression
- Pre-gastrulation and PS formation, Activin induces the expression of WNT3 ligand, which activates beta-catenin and downstream ME differentiation genes (including T, MIXL1, and EOMES)
- In hESCs, activation of ME genes are directly counteracted by YAP
- YAP/TAZ acts as a transcriptional repressor instead of coactivator for ME genes
- YAP repression involves recruiting the NuRD complex
	- This prevents displacement of promoter-proximal nucleosomes at the ME genes
- YAP does not regulate canonical Wnt or Activin target genes but instead functions as a ME gene-specific corepressor
- YAP KO exposed to Activin only differentiate specifically into cardiac mesoderm cells 
	- This did not stimulate most canonical Wnt target genes nor activate Wnt-responsive cardiac developmental inhibitors CDX2 or MSX1
# Results
## YAP prevents hESC differentiation in response to Activin signaling
- YAP ablation had no effect on TAZ expression nor affect TEAD4 levels
- Expression of YAP target gene *CTGF* was greatly reduced
- YAP KO hESCs displayed higher rate of apoptosis, but still readily formed colonies that expressed high levels of OCT4 pluripotency marker
- Activin synergizes with Wnt ligands to induce ME developmental genes
	- YAP selectively repressed these genes
- Chir99021 was used for the RNA-seq experiment to elevate ME gene expression to similar levels of Activin only treated WT hESCs
	- T was much strongly induced by Activin only treatment on YAP KO hESCs than WT hESCs
## β-Catenin is required for Activin-induced differentiation of YAP knockout hESCs

## Activin induces genome-wide recruitment of β-catenin to chromatin in YAP knockout cells
## YAP represses the WNT3 and NODAL enhancers in hESCs

## WNT3 activation is essential for Activin-induced differentiation in YAP knockout cells

## YAP prevents SMAD2,3 binding to the WNT3 promoter and counteracts transcription elongation

## Activin-treated YAP knockout cells induce the cardiac mesoderm program

## Activin-induced Smad2,3 counteract β-catenin activity on the CDX2 gene

## Activin-treated YAP knockout hESCs progress toward cardiomyocytes

## YAP does not block intermediate stages of cardiomyogenesis
