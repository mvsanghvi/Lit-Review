# Intro
# Results
## YAP prevents hESC differentiation in response to Activin signaling
## β-Catenin is required for Activin-induced differentiation of YAP knockout hESCs

## Activin induces genome-wide recruitment of β-catenin to chromatin in YAP knockout cells
## YAP represses the WNT3 and NODAL enhancers in hESCs

## WNT3 activation is essential for Activin-induced differentiation in YAP knockout cells

## YAP prevents SMAD2,3 binding to the WNT3 promoter and counteracts transcription elongation

## Activin-treated YAP knockout cells induce the cardiac mesoderm program

## Activin-induced Smad2,3 counteract β-catenin activity on the CDX2 gene

## Activin-treated YAP knockout hESCs progress toward cardiomyocytes

## YAP does not block intermediate stages of cardiomyogenesis
