[[Yap]] [[Week 2]]

# Introduction
# Results
## YAP Overexpression in Human ESCs and iPSCs Promotes a Naive State
- YAP mRNA is upregulated in the epiblast of the blastocyst and that YAP protein is localized to the nucleus in both the ICM and the trophectoderm
- YAP overexpression in N2B27+2iFL have drastically increased clonal growth after trypsinization to single cells compared to H9 and H9 YAP overexpression in primed conditions
## LPA Activates YAP and Promotes Generation of Transgene-free Human Naive PSCs
## Yin-PSCs and Lin-PSCs Have a Naive-Associated Transcriptional Profile Distinct from that of Primed PSCs
## Further Characterization of Naive Pluripotency in Yin-PSCs and Lin-PSCs
## YAP Regulates the Human Naive State and Acts in Part by Modulating Wnt Signaling
- CHIR99021 is major contributor to H9 ESCs indergoing rapid morphological differentiation
- CRISPR YAP -/- had impaired ability to form naive colonies, especially in 5iLA
