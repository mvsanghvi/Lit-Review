# Introduction
# Results
## YAP is expressed in human neural in vitro systems and is negatively correlated with neuronal differentiation.
## Low-density culture conditions enhance nuclear YAP expression and change neural cell fate.

## A CD15, CD44 and CD49d code identifies a YAP-positive neural crest subset.

## YAP and retinoic acid signaling promote early neural crest phenotype and migration
# Discussion
