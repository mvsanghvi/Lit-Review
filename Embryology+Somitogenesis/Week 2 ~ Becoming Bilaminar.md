[[Week 0-8 ~ Embryology Overview]]
[[Week 1 ~ Gametogenesis+Fertilzation]]

Week 2 is the "rule of twos" week

1. <u>BECOMING FULLY IMPLANTED</u>
	- Days 6-9: Embryo becomes fully implanted in endometrium
	- <u>Cytoptrophoblast</u>- Cells that line trophoblast wall and retain their cell membranes
		- Secretes proteolytic enzymes to break down the ecm between endometrial cells
	- <u>Syncytiotrophoblast</u>- Mass of cytoplasm containing numerous dispersed nuclei
		- Some proliferating cells lose their membranes and coalesce into syncytium
			- Increases in volume throught week 2
				- Cells detach from cytotrophoblast at embryonic pole and fuse with syncytium
		- Finger-like processes extend from it and penetrate between the separating endometrial cells and pull the embryo
			- Gradually envelopes the blastocyst as implantation progresses
	- Day 9: Syncytiotrophoblast blankets entire blastocyst except for abembryonic pole region
	- Coagulation plug of acellular material seals small hole where blastocyst implanted
2. <u>EMBRYOBLAST REORGANIZES INTO EPIBLAST AND HYPOBLAST</u>
	- Pre-implantation, embryoblast differentiates into 2 epithelial layers
	- Day 8: Embryo consists of:
		1. <u>Epiblast</u>- Distinct external/upper layer of columnar cells
		2. <u>Hypoblast/Primitive endoderm</u>- Internal/lower lever of cuboidal cells
	- Extracellular basement membrane is laid down between the two layers
		- The two-layerd embryoblast= <u>Bilaminar embryonic disc</u>/<u>Bilaminar blastoderm</u>
	- With formation of the disc, define the primitive <u>dorsal-ventral axis</u>
3. <u>DEVELOPMENT OF AMNIOTIC CAVITY</u>
	- Day 8: Amniotic cavity appears as fluid collects between epiblast cells and overlying trophoblast
	1. A layer of epiblast cells expands towards embryonic pole and differentiates into amnion
		- <u>Amnion</u>- Thin membrane that separates amniotic cavity from the cytotrophoblast
			- 1 out 4 extrambryonic membranes:
				1. Amnion
				2. Chorion
				3. Yolk Sac
				4. Allantois
	2. Amnion starts smaller than blastocyts cavity, then expands steadily
	3. Amnion encloses entire embryo by week 8
4. <u>DEVELOPMENT OF YOLK SAC AND CHORIONIC CAVITY</u>
	- 
5. <u>UTEROPLACENTAL CIRCULATORY SYSTEM BEGINS TO DEVELOP DURING THE SECOND WEEK</u>
	- Nutrient uptake and waste elimination process changes
		1. Week 1: Embryo uses simple diffusion
		2. Day 9: Begins to form <u>uteroplacental circulation</u>- System by which maternal and fetal blood flow through the placenta to come into close proximity and exchange gases by metabolic diffusion
			- Rapid embryo growth causes the formation of the more effecient system 
				1. Trophablastic lacunae (vacuoles) open within the syncytiotrophoblast
				2. Maternal capillaries near the syncytiotrophoblast expand, forming maternal sinusoids that anastomose with the tropblastic lacunae
					- <u>Anastomose</u>-The connection of separate parts of a branching system to form a network, as of leaf veins, blood vessels, or a river and its branches
		3. Day 11-13: Anastomosation continues and cytotrophoblast proliferates locally to form extensions growing into syncytiotrophoblast
		4. Extensions grow out into blood-filled lacunae while covered in syncytiotrophoblast- <u>1째 chorionic stem villi</u>
		5. Day 16: Cytrtrophoblast's extraembryonic mesoderm penetrates core of the stem villi- <u>2째 chorionic stem villi</u>
		6. End of week 3: 2째 villi give rise to blood vessels connected to vessels forming in the embryo proper
			- Estabilishes a working uteroplacental circulation (primitive heart starts beating day 22)
			- Villi with differentiated blood vessels- <u>3째 chorionic stem villi</u>
	-  Diffusing nutrients, gases, and wastes between maternal and fetal blood cross four tissue layers
		1. Endothelium of villus capillaries
		2. Loose connective tissue in the core of the villus
		3. Syncytiotrophoblast layer
		4. Cytotrophoblast player
			- Maternal layers are not crossed because they do not invade the trophoblastic lacunae
