[[Week 0-8 ~ Embryology Overview]]
[[Week 1 ~ Gametogenesis+Fertilzation]]

Week 2 is the "rule of twos" week

1. <u>BECOMING FULLY IMPLANTED</u>
	- Days 6-9: Embryo becomes fully implanted in endometrium
	- <u>Cytoptrophoblast</u>- Cells that line trophoblast wall and retain their cell membranes
		- Secretes proteolytic enzymes to break down the ecm between endometrial cells
	- <u>Syncytiotrophoblast</u>- Mass of cytoplasm containing numerous dispersed nuclei
		- Some proliferating cells lose their membranes and coalesce into syncytium
			- Increases in volume throught week 2
				- Cells detach from cytotrophoblast at embryonic pole and fuse with syncytium
		- Finger-like processes extend from it and penetrate between the separating endometrial cells and pull the embryo
			- Gradually envelopes the blastocyst as implantation progresses
	- Day 9: Syncytiotrophoblast blankets entire blastocyst except for abembryonic pole region
	- Coagulation plug of acellular material seals small hole where blastocyst implanted
2. <u>EMBRYOBLAST REORGANIZES INTO EPIBLAST AND HYPOBLAST</u>
3. <u>DEVELOPMENT OF AMNIOTIC CAVITY</u>
4. <u>DEVELOPMENT OF YOLK SAC AND CHORIONIC CAVITY</u>
5. <u>UTEROPLACENTAL CIRCULATORY SYSTEM BEGINS TO DEVELOP DURING THE SECOND WEEK</u>
