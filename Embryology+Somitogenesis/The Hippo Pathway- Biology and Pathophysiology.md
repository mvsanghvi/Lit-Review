[[Week 4]]

<u>Overview</u>
- Pathway initially discovered in Drosophila
- Key regulator of tissue growth
	- Signaling cascade regulates numerous biological processes:
		a) Cell growth/fate decision
		b) Organ size control
		c) Regeneration
- Core of the pathway in mammals consists of:
	1. Kinase cascade
	2. MST1/2 and LATS1/2
	3. Downstream effectors
	4. Transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ
		- These control transcriptional programs involved in:
			a) Cell proliferation
			b) Survival
			c) Mobility
			d) Stemness
			e) Differenentiation
	- Tightly regulated by intrinsic and extrinsic signals like:
		a) Mechanical force
		b) Cell-cell contact
		c) Polarity
		d) Energy status
		e) Stress
		f) Many diffusible hormal factors (majority of which act through G protein-coupled receptors)
<u>Introduction</u>
- Organ size control is central question in biology as an evolutionary milestone
