[[A brief history of the segmentation clock- Olivier Pourquie]]
[[Recapitulating human segmentation clock w PSCs]]

- 25 years ago, Palmeirim reported 1st molecular evidence of gene linked to periodicity of somite formation
	- Founded idea of developmental clock- A network of genes whose expression oscillates synchronously and thus regulates the timing of developmental events
	- As the PSM grows, the rostral (head) end of the tissue segments repeatedly, and new segments are generated with species specific periodicity
- 90's- Genes were found to regulate fruit fly body segmentation, but the vertebrate homologues were not relevant to somite formation
	- On the flip, vertebrate homologue genes NOT involved in fruit fly segmentation
