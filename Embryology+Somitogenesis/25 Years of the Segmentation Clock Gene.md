[[A brief history of the segmentation clock- Olivier Pourquie]]
[[Recapitulating human segmentation clock w PSCs]]

<u>History of the Field:</u>
- 25 years ago, Palmeirim reported 1st molecular evidence of gene linked to periodicity of somite formation
	- Founded idea of developmental clock- A network of genes whose expression oscillates synchronously and thus regulates the timing of developmental events
	- As the PSM grows, the rostral (head) end of the tissue segments repeatedly, and new segments are generated with species specific periodicity
- 90's- Genes were found to regulate fruit fly body segmentation, but the vertebrate homologues were not relevant to somite formation
	- On the flip, vertebrate homologue genes NOT involved in fruit fly segmentation (ie Notch) were involved in mice somite formation
- In chicks, *c-hairy1* transcription oscillated with a period identical to its segmentation clock
	- The gene *hairy* dispelled notion that segmentation arose independently in flies and vertebrates
	- Propogated in waves up the PSM in a dynamic pattern that could be split into 3 stages:
		1. Stage 1: broad, caudal expression
		2. Stage 2: Narrower, rostral expression
		3. Stage 3: Narrowest rostral expression
			- Expression continued in rostral PSM in culture even with caudal parts removed in the embryo
				- ***Indicates that oscillations are autonomous property of the PSM***
	- Provided evidence that the developmental clock is linked to segmentation and revealed:
		a. Expression can oscillate with  periodicity, as short as 90 mins
		b. Oscillations can be synchronized between cells
	- Study led to development of new filed that aimed to identify central genetic components of the clock and to understand the synchronous oscillatory expression mechanism
- Homologue of *c-hairy1* is *Hes7* in mice and *HES7* in humans
	- *her1* and *her7* in zebrafish
	- ***These homogloues encode protein that repress transcription***
	- Oscillates autonomously as result of negative feedback loop:
		- The protein represses the transcription of the gene that encodes it
- Can speed up mouse clock osciallation by deleting two non-protein coding introns from *Hes7*
	- Generates more somites too
	- [[Accelerating the Tempo of the Segmentation Clock by Reducing the Number of Introns in the Hes7 Gene]]
- *Hes7* and its homologues are the central pacemakers of the segmentation clock
- Delta oscillatation is controlled by *Hes7*
	- Part of [[Notch Signalling]] pathway
		- Notch pathway signals between cells to activate the transcription of genes
	- Controls the timing of HES 7 in neighbouring cells, leading to synchronization
- 

<u>Gaps in the field and future directions:</u>
- We know:
	- Oscillations proceed stably in single, isolated cells of the PSM
		- Suggests the clock is intrinsic
	- However, random mixtures of cells synchronize their oscillations and self organise in rostral-caudal axis
		- Suggests extrinsic control 
	- Notch signaling required for self-organization 
- We don't get:
	- Coordinating oscillation patterns is not yet understood
	- What are the downstream genes whose expression oscillates in different phases from the main clock's components depending on the cell's position in the rostral-caudal axis
