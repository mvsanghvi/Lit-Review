# Forming the Embryo
[[Embryology Overview]]
[[Week 3]]

1. <u>TUBE-WITHIN-TUBE BODY PLAN ARISES THROUGH BODY FOLDING</u>
2. <u>NEURULATION: ESTABLISHIN NEURAL TUBE, RUDIMENT OF CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM</u>
3. <u>SECONDARY NEURULATION</u>
4. <u>CRANIAL-CAUDAL REGIONALIZATION OF NEURAL TUBE</u>
5. <u>NEURAL CREST CELLS</u>
	**Neural Crest Cell Originate During Neurulation**
	**Neural Crest Cells Undergo Extensive Migration Along Well-defined Pathways**
	**Neural Crest Cells Have Many Diverse Derivatives**
	a.  <u>Cranial Nueral Crest Cells</u>
	- 
	b. <u>Vagal Neural Crest Cells</u>
	- 
	c. <u>Trunk Neural Crest Cells</u>
	- 
	d. <u>Sacral/Lumbosacral Neural Crest Cells</u>
	- 
6. <u>SOMITE DIFFERENTIATION: FORMING DERMAMYOTOME AND SCLEROTOME</u>
