# Integrated Regulation of Toll-like Receptor Responses by Notch and Interferon-γ Pathways


## Intro
## Results
### TLRs Directly Induce Expression of Canonical Notch Target Genes
### TLR-Induced Gene Expression is Regulated by the Notch Pathway
### Notch-Target-Gene Induction is Dependent on Canonical TLR Signaling Pathways
- Knock down of IKKβ attenuated (reduced) *HES1* expression, but knock down of IKKα had no effect on its expression
- Hes1 is not known to be regulated by NF-κB or p38-activated transcription factors [[Notch Signalling- A simple pathway becomes complex]]
