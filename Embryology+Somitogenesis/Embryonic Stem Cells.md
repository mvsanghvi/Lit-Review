Stem Cells and Development (2007)

# Abstract
- To date [as of 2007], only 3 species have yielded long-term cultures of self-renewing ES cells
	1. Mice
	2. Monkey
	3. Human
- Cells have special requirements to maintain their un
	- Feeder cell
	- Serum
	- Cytokine
# Intro
- 1981: 1st reported technique culturing mouse embryonic stem cells
- 1994: 1st isolated human embryonic stem cells
- 1998: 1st continuous hESC lines established
# Embryology
- At the morula stage, the morula enters the uterine cavity from the fallopian tube
	- After arrival, it forms the blastocoel
- The blastocyst is made of 40-150 cells and forms:
	- The outer part- the trophoblast
		- Outer syncytiotrophoblast
		- Inner cytotrophoblast
	- The inner part- The ICM/embryoblast
		- The ICM forms a bilaminar embryo composed of: 
			- Source of the pluripotent ES cells 
			- Epiblast adjacent to trophoblast 
				- Gives rise to all 3 germ layers 
			- Hypoblast adjacent to blastocyst cavity
# Types
- ES cells
	- Early ESCs: Formed during cleavage, before blastocyst formation [[Week 1]]
	- Blastocyst ESCs: Pluripotent cells from the ICM [[Week 2]]
		- Form ALMOST any kind of cell in the body
- Fetal stem cells
	- Pluripotent cells responsible for initial development of all tissues before birth
- Umbilical cord stem cells
	- Blood contains multipotent stem cells genetically identical to the fetus
- Adult stem cells
	- Multipotent stem cells
	- Present in already developed tissues to direct their growth/maintenance throughout life 
	- Common locations:
		- Nerve cells
		- Bone marrow (hematopoietic stem cells)
		- Muscle
		- Bone
		- Skin
	- Can differentiate into other types of tissue
		- Depending on plasticity, i.e. growth or differentiation conditions
# Derivation
# Culturing ES Cells
## Maintaining stem cells in the pluripotent state
- ES cells require feeder cells for their growth and culture
- MEFS (mitotically inactivated murine embryonic fibroblasts) are most commonly used as the feeder layer
### Culturing mESCs
- Cultured in complete ES medium in presence of a feeder layer of MEFs to maintain undifferentiated state
- Exogenously added LIF (Leukemia inhibitory factor) also prevent differentiation
- Routinely passaged every 2-3 days to prevent differentiation
### Culturing hESCs
- Culturing requires feeder layers and either:
	1. Presence of serum
	2. bFGF (basic fibroblast growth factor) when in the absence of serum
- Passaged every 4-6 days to prevent differentiation 
### Alternatives to MEFS for mESCs
- Requirement for serum or LIF for undifferentiated growth of mESC has been shown to be overcome by supplementing the cultures with BMP (bone morphogenetic protein)/GDF (growth and differentiation factor)
- Overexpressing Nanog "locks in" mESC identity and provides resistance to differentiation-inducing stimuli 
### Alternatives to MEFS for hESCs
- LIF DOESN'T prevent hESC differentiation, like it does in mESCs, when feeders are absent
