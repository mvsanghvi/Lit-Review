Stem Cells and Development (2007)

# Abstract
- To date [as of 2007], only 3 species have yielded long-term cultures of self-renewing ES cells
	1. Mice
	2. Monkey
	3. Human
- Cells have special requirements to maintain their un
	- Feeder cell
	- Serum
	- Cytokine
# Intro
- 1981: 1st reported technique culturing mouse embryonic stem cells
- 1994: 1st isolated human embryonic stem cells
- 1998: 1st continuous hESC lines established
