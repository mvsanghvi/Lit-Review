# Role of [[Notch signaling]] in regulating innate immunity and inflammation in health and disease

## Introduction
- 
## Active Notch Signaling Under Inflammatory Conditions
- RBPJ- Gene encoding key nuclear mediator in canonical Notch
- Association of active Notch signaling with inflammatory conditions
	- Mechanisms by which inflammation/infection modulate Notch signaling is poorly understood
		- Is conceivable Notch signaling is promoted by stimuli by either exogenous agents (i.e. pathogens) or endogenous factors (i.e. cytokines)
### Regulation of Notch Signaling by TLRs
- 
### Regulation of Notch signaling by inflammatory cytokines
[[Notch and IFN-gamma Pathways]]
### Molecular mechanisms of Notch Activation by inflammatory stimuli
