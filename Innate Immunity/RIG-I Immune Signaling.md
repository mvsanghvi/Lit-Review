# Immune Signaling by [[RIG-I]]-like Receptors (2011)

## Intro
- Family of the DExD/H box RNA helicases that function as cytoplasmic sensors of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)
- the 3 RLRs are broadly expressed in most tissues, signaling innate immunity activation in a variety of cell types
- RLR expression maintained at low levels at resting
	- Increased with IFN exposure and post infection
- RLRs share a number of structural similarities such as organization into 3 distinct domains
	1. N-terminal region with tandem caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARD)
	2. Central DExD/H box RNA helicase domain with capacity to hydrolyze ATP and bind (and maybe unwind) RNA
	3. C-terminal repressor domain (RD) embedded in C-terminal domain (CTD) in case RIG-I involvement in autoregulation
		- LGP2 lacks the N-terminal CARDs and believed to regulating RIG-I and MDA5 signaling
## Pathogen Sensing by the RLRs
- Initially characterized as dsRNA-binding protein that triggered IFN induction and virus signaling in response to synthetic dsRNA poly(I:C)
- RIG-I preferentially recognizes RNA sequences with 5' triphosphorylated (5'ppp) ends, which serve in part to define a non-self RNA PAMP
	- Removing the 5'ppp abrogates signaling
	- Di/mono-phosphate mods severely attenuate signaling
	- Synthetic 5'ppp-ssRNA failed to drive RIG-I signaling when lack of polynucleotide motifs or short complementary sequence
		- 5'ppp alone is insufficient
- RNA detection independent of length
- At least 1 phosphate at the 5' end of RNA is required to trigger RIG-I signaling
	- Full 5'ppp required for full signaling potential
- RIG-I associates preferentially with short 5'ppp-RNA and RNA with some dsRNA regions
- MDA5 preferentially recognizes high mol weight poly(I:C) fragments
- RIG-I preferentially recognizes short RNA fragments
	- Also binds to ssRNA
- Blunt end dsRNA as short as 23 bp triggers RIG-I signaling 
	- Has preference to the blunt end over 5'/3' overhangs
## RNA Ligand Specifications
- RIG-I preferentially signals IFN expression in response to polyuridine motifs that contain interspersed C nucleotides (poly-U/UC)
- Deletion of (poly-U/UC completely abrogated RIG-I signaling even though 5'ppp existed
- RIG-I is predicted to respond through recognition of non-self product of pol III transcription.
- RNA cleavage products generated by 2',5'-linked oligoadenylate-activated RNase L ribonuclease can trigger RLR-dependent IFN induction
	- May serve as means to amplify response through RLR substrate production
	- RNase L cleavage products don't contain 5'ppp
		- Have 3'monophosphatein a context of a short length (<200 nt) essential for RLR signaling
- RNA marked via endonucleolytic cleavage may offer PAMP signature through combo of length and 5'/3' terminal structure
- Binding of 5'ppp RNA to RIG-I predicted as well as anchoring the RNA ligand through interaction with specific charged residues within ligand binding groove of RD or CTD
	- Synthetic dsRNA poly(I:C) is predicted to differentially bind to RIG-I via dsRNA-interaction site within the helicase domain
		- Analysis of RD and CTD from RLRs suggest formation of distinct RNA-binding loops that impart basis for ligand specificity.
## RLR Activation and Autoregulation
- Model of RIG-I autoregulation where absence of RNA ligand, RIG-I is held in "closed" conformation
	- Predicted that CARDs are sequestered from signaling interactions through intramolecular association with the RD
- In "open" conf., RIG-I becomes signaling active and probably multimerizes
	- CARDS is now able to mediate associated with adaptor protein MAVS to induce IFN production and expression of host defense genes
## Cell-Intrinsic Innate Immunity 
- Key transcriptional factors involved in RLR and MAVs signaling include interferon regulatory factor 3 and 7 (IRF 3 and 7) and NF-κB
	- IRF3 and 7= Latent TFs that are phosphoed by IκB kinases, accumulate in the nuclei, and bind to target sequence
	- NF-κB requires IKK-mediated phosphoed of IκBα that then is subjected to ubiquitin-dependent degradation by proteasomes
- IRF3 is constitutively expressed; IRF7 expression remains low until induced by IFN presence (+ feedback loop)
	- IRF3 through to function in immediate early enhanceosomes in most cell types while IRF7 directs later transcription programs
- IFN-β produced & secreted by RLR cascade binds to IFN receptor to direct JAK-STAT signaling and expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs)
	- Signaling amplifies IFN response by increasing expression of IFNα subtypes (+ feedback loop)
	- Other ISGs include PRRs (all RLRs and members of TLRs)
## Inflammatory Signaling
- Infection and signaling through RLRs also induces IFN-λ family expression
- RLR signaling through RIG-I, MAVS, TBK1, and IRF3 required for IFN-λ induction
	- Analysis of promoter regions upstream of IFN-λ genes show numerous cis-acting elements for IRFS and NF-κB binding
		- Thus suggests type I IFN and IFN-λ induction occur through similar pathways and RLR signaling also induces IFN-λ expression to control infection
- Recent studies suggest RLR signaling mediates proinflam response via 2 pathways
	1. Involves MAVS-CARD9-Bcl10-dependent transcription of many NF-κB target genes
	2. RIG-I association with ASC protein
		- This triggers inflammasome activation and processing of proinflam cytokines (ie. IL-1β and IL-18)
## Signaling Cross Talk
- RLR signaling shares numerous components with other cellular pathways
- RLR signaling to IRF 3, 7 and NF-κB regulated by complex signaling transduction events involve components that overlap with TLR signaling pathways
	- MAVs interacts with tumor necrosis factor receptor I (TNFR)-associated death domain (TRADD) protein.
	- TRADD recruitment important for RLR signaling
- Relationship between adaptor proteins NAP1 and SINTBAD unclear, but loss of either impairs signaling through both TLR and RLR pathways 
- RLR signaling intersects with members of NLR family
	- NLRX1 (Nod9) potentially inhibits RLR-dependent IFN induction through disrupting MAVs interactions
	- NLRC5 interacts with RIG-I (not MAVS) to inhibit IFN responses through interacting with IKKα/β, preventing their phospho
		- siRNA silencing of NLRC5 enhanced NF-κB transcriptional activity to drive IFN production
## Positive and Negative Regulation through Differential Ubiquitination and Polyubiquitin Binding
- Posttranslational modifications (ptms) such a ubiquitination or deubiquitination of key components of the RLR signaling pathway appears to be a major point of regulation
- Free K63-linked polyubiquitin chains can induce RIG-I activation
	- Therefore K172-mediated polyubiquitin bind (not ubiquitin mods) might drive RIG-I activation
	- K63-linked polyubiquitin chains act as 2nd ligand to enhance RIG-I signaling activation
- Lack of conservation across species
	- lysine 172 of RIG-I is not conserved between species
	- Regulation of phosphorylation of serine 8 is not likely universal
		- aa residue is shared only among primate RIG-I and not non-primate species
## RLRs Cooperate with Other PRRs in the Detection of Viruses
- RLRs do not operate along to induce/program antiviral immunity
	- Part of concerted and cross-talking antiviral program mediated by a variety of PRRs
- In case of West nile virus (WNV), infection stimulates RLR signaling, but has 2nd round that stimulates TLRs
	- Round 1: RLR signaling & IFN production against infection enhances Round 2: TLR expression
		- RLR provides signaling crosstalk to enhance TLR expression and function, leading to global immune modulation
	- RIG-I and MDA5 appear to cooperate direct innate immune response and IFN amplification
- RIG-I lacking cells are able to mount IFN-dependent antiviral response, albeit attenuated and delayed compared to WT
- RIG-I, MDA5, or MAVS KO had abrogated signaling in cells
	- Also led to enhanced virus replication
- TLR3 KO mice improved survival rate against WNV than WT
	- Due to decrease of inflam response
- RLR crosstalk signaling with TLR3 and TLR7 to enhance TLR signaling
