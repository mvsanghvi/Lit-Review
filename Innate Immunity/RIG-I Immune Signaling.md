# Immune Signaling by [[RIG-I]]-like Receptors (2011)

## Intro
- Family of the DExD/H box RNA helicases that function as cytoplasmic sensors of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)
- the 3 RLRs are broadly expressed in most tissues, signaling innate immunity activation in a variety of cell types
- RLR expression maintained at low levels at resting
	- Increased with IFN exposure and post infection
- RLRs share a number of structural similarities such as organization into 3 distinct domains
	1. N-terminal region with tandem caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARD)
	2. Central DExD/H box RNA helicase domain with capacity to hydrolyze ATP and bind (and maybe unwind) RNA
	3. C-terminal repressor domain (RD) embedded in C-terminal domain (CTD) in case RIG-I involvement in autoregulation
		- LGP2 lacks the N-terminal CARDs and believed to regulating RIG-I and MDA5 signaling
## Pathogen Sensing by the RLRs
- Initially characterized as dsRNA-binding protein that triggered IFN induction and virus signaling in response to synthetic dsRNA poly(I:C)
- RIG-I preferentially recognizes RNA sequences with 5' triphosphorylated (5'ppp) ends, which serve in part to define a non-self RNA PAMP
	- Removing the 5'ppp abrogates signaling
	- Di/mono-phosphate mods severely attenuate signaling
	- Synthetic 5'ppp-ssRNA failed to drive RIG-I signaling when lack of polynucleotide motifs or short complementary sequence
		- 5'ppp alone is insufficient
- RNA detection independent of length
- At least 1 phosphate at the 5' end of RNA is required to trigger RIG-I signaling
	- Full 5'ppp required for full signaling potential
- RIG-I associates preferentially with short 5'ppp-RNA and RNA with some dsRNA regions
- MDA5 preferentially recognizes high mol weight poly(I:C) fragments
- RIG-I preferentially recognizes short RNA fragments
	- Also binds to ssRNA
- Blunt end dsRNA as short as 23 bp triggers RIG-I signaling 
	- Has preference to the blunt end over 5'/3' overhangs
## RNA Ligand Specifications
- RIG-I preferentially signals IFN expression in response to polyuridine motifs that contain interspersed C nucleotides (poly-U/UC)
- Deletion of (poly-U/UC completely abrogated RIG-I signaling even though 5'ppp existed
- RIG-I is predicted to respond through recognition of non-self product of pol III transcription.
- RNA cleavage products generated by 2',5'-linked oligoadenylate-activated RNase L ribonuclease can trigger RLR-dependent IFN induction
	- May serve as means to amplify response through RLR substrate production
	- RNase L cleavage products don't contain 5'ppp
		- Have 3'monophosphatein a context of a short length (<200 nt) essential for RLR signaling
- RNA marked via endonucleolytic cleavage may offer PAMP signature through combo of length and 5'/3' terminal structure
- Binding of 5'ppp RNA to RIG-I predicted as well as anchoring the RNA ligand through interaction with specific charged residues within ligand binding groove of RD or CTD
	- Synthetic dsRNA poly(I:C) is predicted to differentially bind to RIG-I via dsRNA-interaction site within the helicase domain
		- Analysis of RD and CTD from RLRs suggest formation of distinct RNA-binding loops that impart basis for ligand specificity.
## RLR Activation and Autoregulation
- Model of RIG-I autoregulation where absence of RNA ligand, RIG-I is held in "closed" conformation
