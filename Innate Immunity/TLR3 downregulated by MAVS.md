# TLR3 signaling is downregulated by [[MAVS]] isoform in epithelial cells

## Intro
## Results
### 3.1 Extracellular dsRNA signaling in HCT116 relies on TLR3.TRIF and is negatively regulated by MAVS
### 3.2 MAVS silencing upregulates NF-ÎºB and IRF3 signaling without affecting TLR3 levels
### 3.3 MiniMAVS overexpression downregulates IFN-B expression following TLR3 stimulation
