# Role of [[Notch signaling]] in regulating innate immunity and inflammation in health and disease

## Introduction
- Notch signaling pathway is evolutionarily conserved
	- Regulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell fate decisions during development and adult tissue homeostasis
- Mammalian cells have 4 Notch receptors 
	- are large single-pass type I transmembrane proteins involved in transducing specific extracellular signals to the nucleus in response to ligand binding. 
	- Notch 1-4
## Active Notch Signaling Under Inflammatory Conditions
- RBPJ- Gene encoding key nuclear mediator in canonical Notch
- Association of active Notch signaling with inflammatory conditions
	- Mechanisms by which inflammation/infection modulate Notch signaling is poorly understood
		- Is conceivable Notch signaling is promoted by stimuli by either exogenous agents (i.e. pathogens) or endogenous factors (i.e. cytokines)
### Regulation of Notch Signaling by TLRs
- TLRs- Toll-Like Receptors
- TLRs modulate Notch signaling by inducing Notch receptor and ligand expression [[Notch Signaling activation via TLR stimulation]]
	- Purified and synthetic TLR ligands were able to induce Notch receptor and ligands
		- Used Bacterial and viral pathogens
	- Through augmenting Notch receptor and/or ligand expression, TLR signaling indirectly promotes Notch pathway activation/expression of canonical Notch target genes
		- Believed to be dependent on de novo protein synthesis
- Activation of Notch target genes (i.e. Hes1 and Hey1) can be directly induced by TLR stimulation
	- Direct activation due to 2, non-mutually exclusive mechanisms:
		1) Signal 1: Provided by tonic Notch signaling
		2) Signal 2: Provided by acute TLR signaling
			- Cooperation of both signaling pathways is required for optimal activation
				- Individually, they are necessary but not sufficient
- Still unknown is the signal coupling acute TLR signaling to Notch pathway activation
