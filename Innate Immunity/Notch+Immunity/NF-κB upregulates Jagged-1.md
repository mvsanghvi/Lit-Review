# Rel/NF-κB can trigger the Notch signaling pathway by inducing the expression of Jagged1, a ligand for Notch receptors
## Introduction
- 
## Results
### Ectopic Rel protein expression induces jagged1 transcripts
### jagged1 gene expression is dependent upon endogenous NF-κB activation
### Cell surface expression of Jagged1 promotes cell-cell interactions
### c-Rel leads to activation of the Notch signaling pathway
### jagged1 is highly expressed in peripheral lymphoid organs and in splenic B cells
## Discussion
### Interplay between the Rel/NF-κB and Notch signaling pathways
### Relevance to the immune system
