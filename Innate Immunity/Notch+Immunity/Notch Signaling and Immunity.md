# Notch Signaling at the crossroads of innate and adaptive immunity

## Intro
- Heritable mutated allele *"Notch"* led to small indentation in *Drosophila* wing margins observed by John Dexter+Thomas Morgan
- In the 1990's, mutated gain-of-function (GOF) *NOTCH* allele in human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia
- Has well established roles in embryonic hematopoiesis
- Focus of this paper is on [[Notch Signaling]] activity in regards to :
	1. Development
	2. Differentiation
	3. Function
	of adult adaptive and innate immune cells
- Canonical Notch pathway operates via juxtacrine interactions between signal-sending cells presenting Notch ligands and signal- receiving cells expressing Notch receptors
	- Mammals have 
		a) 4 Notch family members (Notch 1-4) 
		b) 5 ligands 
			i) Jagged (Jagged 1,2-orthologs to fly Serrate)
			ii) Delta-like families (Dll1,3,4-orthologs to fly Delta)
	1. Notch extracellular domain (receptors Notch1-4) binds to either Jagged or Delta-like ligands through EGF-like repeats
	2. Receptor ligation induces regulated cleavages, releasing the intracellular domain of Notch (ICN) into the cytoplasm
		a) First cleavage occurs at an extracellular site via ADAM10 metalloprotease
	3. ICN is released to migrate to the nucleus
	4. In the nucleus, ICN interacts with TF RBP-J and a transcriptional coactivator (MAML1-3)
	5. The complex recruits a larger transcriptional activation complex, inducing target gene activation
	6. ICN rapidly degrades after the formation of the transcription complex
	- Lack of both signal amplification and complex signal transductions steps in the cytoplasm render the Notch pathway to be very sensitive to precise regulation via dose, duration, and contexts of signals
	- Non-canonical Notch signaling can signal independently of RBP-J and MAML
