## Cross Talk Between Notch and NF-κB
### Transcriptional Regulation of NF-κB Pathway Members
### Transcriptional Regulation of Notch Pathway Members by NF-κB
- Cross talk mechanism described primarily in context of **B cells** 
- Reported transcriptional upregulation of Notch ligand Jagged-1 by NF-κB
- Notch-2 and NF-κB reported to cooperate
	- NF-κB stimulates expression of Hes-5 and Deltex-1
