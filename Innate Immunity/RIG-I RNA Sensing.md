# [[RIG-I]]-like Receptors: Their regulation and roles in RNA sensing

## Intro
- Nucleic acid sensors survey different subcellular compartments and include the endosomal TLRs, cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS, and RLRs
- RLRs: All have a central helicase domain and a carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) 
	- Both work together to detect immunostimulatory RNAs.
- RIG-I also has 2 amino-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs)
	- CARDs mediates downstream signal transduction
- LGP2 believed to regulate RIG-I
	- Lacks CARDs
- RIG-I at rest is in a signaling-repressed, closed conformation that is mediated by specific contacts of CARD2 with an inserting domain between 2 RecA-like helicase domains of RIG-I
	- When bound to RNA ligand, helicase domain tightly wraps around the RNA in a C-clamp fashion

## RLR recognition of immunostimulatory RNA
### Activation of RIG-I by viral RNAs
- RIG-I monitors the 5' ends of RNA molecules of several biochemical features and is activated by:
	1. Base pairing of RNA with 5' end triphosphate group (PPP) to complementary strand of RNA
	2. Uncapped 5' diphosphate (pp) end
	3. Unmethylated 2'-O position at 5'-terminal
		- CTD has a pocket binding specifically to these 3 conditions
			- The base-paired portion of the RNA forms contacts with the helicase domain, which has ATPase activity
				- ATP hydrolysis determines dissociation rate of RIG-I from RNA
					- Host RNA lack molecular featurs of stimulatory RNAs
						- Cellular mRNAs acquire a cap structure involving 2'-O-methylation in the nucleus following transcription before export to the cytoplasm
						- 
- Stable RIG-I and RNA interaction displaces the CARDs, stopping CARDs interaction with parts of the helicase domain
- Freed CARDs from multiple RIG-I proteins oligomerize and become accessible for MAVs interaction, resulting in downstream signaling
