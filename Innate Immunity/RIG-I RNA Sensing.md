# [[RIG-I]]-like Receptors: Their regulation and roles in RNA sensing

## Intro
- Nucleic acid sensors survey different subcellular compartments and include the endosomal TLRs, cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS, and RLRs
- RLRs: All have a central helicase domain and a carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) 
	- Both work together to detect immunostimulatory RNAs.
- RIG-I also has 2 amino-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs)
	- CARDs mediates downstream signal transduction
- LGP2 believed to regulate RIG-I
	- Lacks CARDs
- RIG-I at rest is in a signaling-repressed, closed conformation that is mediated by specific contacts of CARD2 with an inserting domain between 2 RecA-like helicase domains of RIG-I
	- When bound to RNA ligand, helicase domain tightly wraps around the RNA in a C-clamp fashion

## RLR recognition of immunostimulatory RNA
### Activation of RIG-I by viral RNAs
- RIG-I monitors the 5' ends of RNA molecules of several biochemical features and is activated by:
	1. Base pairing of RNA with 5' end triphosphate group (PPP) to complementary strand of RNA
	2. Uncapped 5' diphosphate (pp) end
	3. Unmethylated 2'-O position at 5'-terminal
		- CTD has a pocket binding specifically to these 3 conditions
			- The base-paired portion of the RNA forms contacts with the helicase domain, which has ATPase activity
				- ATP hydrolysis determines dissociation rate of RIG-I from RNA
					- Host RNA lack molecular featurs of stimulatory RNAs
						- Cellular mRNAs acquire a cap structure involving 2'-O-methylation in the nucleus following transcription before export to the cytoplasm
						- 18S and 28S rRNAs and tRNAs are processed in the nucleus and their mature, cytosolic forms typically only have a single phosphate at the 5' end.
							- Monophosphates (5'P) may even block RIG-I
						- 5S rRNA retains a 5'-ppp moiety, but it's methylated and extensively complexed with proteins. 
- Stable RIG-I and RNA interaction displaces the CARDs, stopping CARDs interaction with parts of the helicase domain
- Freed CARDs from multiple RIG-I proteins oligomerize and become accessible for MAVs interaction, resulting in downstream signaling
### Activation of RIG-I by host RNAs
- Infection can also result in RIG-I activation by host cellular RNAs
- Some herpesviruses lead to:
	- 5S rRNA pseudogene transcripts to become highly enriched
		- Biological function are poorly understood
		- Have 5'ppp groups and self-complementary regions
		- Mislocalize to the cytoplasm in infected cells
	- Vault RNAs (vtRNAs) are highly enriched
		- Are highly self-complementary, are transcribed in the nucleus  with a 5'ppp group from the initiating ribnucleotide
		- vtRNAs participate in the formation of cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein particles called vaults
		- DUSP11 (dual specificity phosphatase 11) usually removes 2 phosphates from the 5' end of vtRNAs to make 5'P.
			- Infection reduces DUSP11, leaving 5'PPP-bearing vtRNAs that then activate RIG-I
	- Concomitantly, non-coding cellular Y-RNAs accumulate in their 5'PPP form and bind to RIG-I
### Activation of RLRs in sterile conditions
- RLR mutations result in spontaneous signaling in absence of stimulation
## RLR regulation
### Regulation by interacting proteins
- Several RLR-binding proteins that regulate RLR activity by modulating several processes: 
	- dsRNA binding to RLRs (i.e. co-receptor proteins)
		- PACT is first reported protein
			- Interacts with RIG-I CTD and stimulates RIG-I ATPase activity
		- ZCCHC3 acts as co-receptor for RIG-I and MDA5 
			- Binds with its C-terminal zinc finger domain to RNAs that activate RLRs while its N-terminal domain interacts with the helicase and CTD of RIG-I and MDA5
	- RLR oligomerization
	- TRIM25-mediated K63-linked ubiquitylation of RLRs
	- subcellular localization of RLRs
### Regulation by non-coding RNAs
- Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and miRNAs have emerged as important regulators of RLR signal transduction
	- Infection/interferon stimulation triggers expression of lncRNAs
		- Often in cell type-specific or tissue-specific manner
	- Upon induction, some lncRNAs and miRNAs promote or dampen RLR signaling by regulating RLR gene expression or other key molecules in the RLR pathway
		- Creating feedback or feedforward regulatory loops
			- NEAT1 (lncRNA) is induced upon hantavirus infection
				- Promotes RIG-I expression
-  TRIM25 is RIG-I activator has RNA-binding capacity as well
	- Is important for E3 ligase activity and has positive effect on RIG-I antiviral signaling
