# [[RIG-I]]-like Receptors: Their regulation and roles in RNA sensing

## Intro
- Nucleic acid sensors survey different subcellular compartments and include the endosomal TLRs, cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS, and RLRs
- RLRs: All have a central helicase domain and a carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) 
	- Both work together to detect immunostimulatory RNAs.
- RIG-I also has 2 amino-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs)
	- CARDs mediates downstream signal transduction
- LGP2 believed to regulate RIG-I
	- Lacks CARDs
- RIG-I at rest is in a signaling-repressed, closed conformation that is mediated by specific contacts of CARD2 with an inserting domain between 2 RecA-like helicase domains of RIG-I
	- When bound to RNA ligand, helicase domain tightly wraps around the RNA in a C-clamp fashion
