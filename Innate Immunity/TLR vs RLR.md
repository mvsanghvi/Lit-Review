# Toll-like Receptor and RIG-I-like Receptor Signaling

## Intro
- Hosts evoke [[Innate Immune System]] response to eliminate invading pathogens
- Post recognition of viral nucleic acids:
	- Pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) initiate signaling pathways
	- Leads to synthesis of  (1) multiple cytokines and (2) inflammatory cytokines
		1. Type I interferon (IFN): IFNα subtypes as well as single IFNβ, IFNω, IFNε, IFNκ 
		2. IL-6, IL-12, and TNFα
	- type I IFN plays an essential role in virus elimination
		- Upregulates transcription of many IFN-inducible genes that influence:
			- protein synthesis
			- growth arrest
			- apoptosis
- Toll-like receptor family (TLRs) contain:
	1. Repeats that mediate recognition of their respective pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)
	2. A transmembrane domain that determines cellular localization
	3. Intracellular domain Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) that is required for triggering downstream signaling pathways
- TLRs have >13 members in mammals
	- TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 represent subfamily localized to intracellular compartments (i.e. endosome and ER) recognize viral nucleic acid species
	- TLR1, TLR2, and TLR4-6, are localized on the cell surface mainly recognizes bacterial cell wall components or viral particles
- RIG-I Like receptors (RLRs) include:
	- RIG-I
	- MDA5
	- LGP2
- TLRs are membrane bound, RLRs are cytoplasmic and recognize RNA species produced there
- IFN-inducible protein kinase PKR is implicated in recognizing RNA with short stem-loops (in RLR-independent manner)
- Host cells can respond to intracellular dsDNA released by:
	- DNA viruses
	- Bacteria
	- Host dying cells
		- Occurs in TLR and RLR-independent mechanisms, such as through DAI molecule
			- DAI molecule is a cytoplasmic DNA sensor that binds dsDNA and induces type I IFN & inflam cytokines
				- Other mechanism responds to dsDNA in DAI deficiency
## Recognition of Viruses by TLR3
- Role of TLR3 in dsRNA recognition, including when dsRNA is produced during ssRNA virus replication
- Also implicated in recognition of siRNA (small interfering)
	- Binds to TRL3 in sequence-independent manner, leads to IL-12 and IFNλ, thus suppressing angiogenesis
		- As opposed action to suppress target gene expression
- TLR3 deficient mice show reduced production of type I IFN, IFNλ, and IL-12p40
## Recognition of Viral Nucleic Acids by TLR7-9
- Guanosine and uridine-rich ssRNAs (from HIV) were identified as natural ligands for TLR7
- Human TLR8 preferentially recognizes ssRNA derived from HIV and R-848
	- TLR8 deficient mice responded normally
		- Suggests species-specific function
- TLR9 recognizes cytidine-phosphate-guanosine (CpG) DNA (rare in vertebrates and frequent in bacteria) and viral DNA
- TLR7 and 9 are localized in endosome
	- Endosomal acidification is required for ligand recognition and signaling
- TLR9 intracellular localization is responsible for discrimination between foreign and endogenous DNA due to constricting interactive with inappropriate DNA
- Single missense mutation in gene encoding UNC-93B (12 membrane protein in the ER) abrogated signaling via TLR7-9
	- Mice show defective cytokine production and reduced upregulation of costimulatory molecules
## Recognition of Viruses by RLRs
- RIG-I is essential for the recognition of a series of ssRNA viruses while avoiding self RNA
- ssRNA requires a 5'ppp moiety for RIG-I to bind to and induce type I IFN
	- Probably does so to discriminate between self and foreign RNA
		- Recomb RIG-I protein binds to dsRNA with either a blunt end, 3', or 5'-overhang
			- 3'-overhang dsRNA doesn't form a stable complex (unlike the 5'-overhang), is rapidly unwound by RIG-I and fails to activate signaling
- C-terminal region involving RD is required for recognition of ssRNA and dsRNA, the recognition increases ATPase activity
### Transcriptional Control of the IFNβ Gene
- IFNβ transcription is rapidly induced through cooperative binding to the positive regulatory domain (PRD) of the promoter by 3 distinct families of TFs:
	1. NF-κB: consists of 5 members
		1. RelA (p65)
			- Heterodimer composed of RelA and p50 is the most frequently activated form in TLR & RLR signaling
		2. RelB
		3. C-Rel
		4. p105 (NF-κB1: p50 precursor)
		5. p100 (NF-κB2: p52 precursor)
		- Stimulation of TLR or RLR ligands rapidly catalyzes the phospho of IκB proteins by the multiprotein IKK complex
			- IκB proteins are subsequently polyubiquitinated and degraded, allowing for NF-κB translocation into the nucleus. 
				- IKKβ (rather than IKKα) plays essential role in NF-κB activation in TLR & RLR signaling
	2. Activating Transcription Factor 2 (ATF2)/c-Jun
		- A component of AP-1, which belongs to the dimeric basic region leucine zipper protein family that binds TPA- or cAMP-response elements present in various cytokine genes
			- AP-1 activation during TLR signaling is controlled through MAPK phosphorylation 
				- These MAPKs are activated w/ similar kinetics after TLR engagement or viral infection
	3. Interferon Regulatory factors IRFs
		- IRFs are mainly activated during virus infection and are likely to determine type I IFN induction specificity
			- IRF3 is critically involved in IFNβ induction after infection
				- Is a constitutively expressed protein that resides in the cytoplasm in unstimulated cells 
					- Viral infection triggers IRF3 phospho at serine/threoine clusters in the C-terminal regulatory regions by virus-activated kinases (VAKs), 
						- Allows IRF3 to form a homodimer, translocate into the nucleus, and bind to DNA to regulate expression of IFNβ and other IFN-stimulate gene 
			- IRF7 is structurally the most similar to IRF3, whose activation is controlled by phospho in the C-terminal region
				- However, IRF7 expression is weak in unstimulated cells, but dramatically induced post stimulation
					- Therefore, IFNβ induction is dependent on initial activation of IRF3
					- Then, secreted IFNβ acts on neighboring cells and activates pathways via type I IFN receptor to induce IRF7 expression, which may result in amplification of type I IFN induction
- TBK1 and IKKε (IKKi) were discovered to be essential to VAKs, which phospho and activated IRF3 and IRF7
	- IKKε expression is restricted to immune cells
		- IKKε deficient mice showed no obvious phenotype regarding IRF3 activation and IFNβ induction
	- TBK1 deficient mice reduced IRF3 nuclear translocation with concomitant decrease in IFNβ production when stimulated
	- Cells deficient of both TBK1 and IKKε have complete loss of IRF3 activation and IFNβ induction
## TLR3 Signaling
- TLRs recruit specific a specific combo of TIR domain containing adapters post PAMP recognition
- TLR signaling can be divided into 2 groups:
	1. myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88)- dependent pathway
	2. TRIF-dependent pathway
		- TIR-containing adaptor protein (TIRAP)/MyD88-adaptor-like (MAL)
		- TRIF/TIR domain-containing adaptor molecule 1 (TICAM1)
		- TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM)/TICAM2
	- Both pathways commonly induce inflammatory cytokines, but each can also induce type I IFN 
- TLR5, 7, and 9 signaling is defective in MyD88-deficient mice post PAMP recognition 
	- Does not require TIRAP, TRIF, or TRAM, so MyD88 the sole adapter
- TLR2 uses MyD88 but also requires TIRAP as an additional adaptor to link itself to MyD88
- TLR3 uses TRIF, but not MyD88
	- TLR3-TRIF pathway activates NF-κB via 2 separates pathways
		1. TRIF N-terminal region contains 3 putative motifs that mediate binding to TRAF6, an adaptor implicated in NF-κB activation. 
			- Ubiquitinated IKKλ and TRAF6 subsequently recruit protein kinase complex involved TAK1 (MAP3 K protein family member)
				- TAK1 suggested to phopho IKKβ
					- TAK1 deficient mice had reduce inflammatory cytokine production and impaired NF-κB activation
		2. TRIF C-terminal region (containing Rip homotypic interaction motif (RHIM) responsible for TRIF and RIP1 (RIP family member involved in TNF receptor-mediated NF-κB activation) interaction)
			- Suggests RIP1 is inducibly polyubiquitinated to form TRAF6 & TAK1 complex, resulting in  NF-κB activation
				- RIP1-deficient cells, TLR3-mediated NF-κB activation is reduced
				- But TRAF6 is reported to be dispensable for TRIF-dependent NF-κB activation in some cells, suggesting cell type-specific contributions of TRAF6 in TRIF-dependent NF-κB activation.
- TLR4 uses all 4 adaptors
	- TRAM links it to TRIF
- IRF3 activation and IFNβ induction post stimulation is impaired in TRIF-deficient mice
	- Indicates IRF3 activation is controlled by TRIF-dependent pathway 
## TLR7 & TLR9 Signaling
- Studies done in pDCs (plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells) because both exclusively expressed by pDCs.
## RLR Signaling
- RLR signaling pathways converge at NF-κB, MAPK, and IRFs for robust type I IFN induction
- MAVs was discovered as an adaptor for RLR that provides a link between RLR and downstream signaling mols
- Overexpression of MAVs activates IFNα4, IFNα6, IFNβ promoter, and NF-κB promoters, resulting in type I IFN production that is sufficient for inhibition of viral replication
- MAVs C-terminal tail (required for mitochondria targeting) deletion abrogates IRF3 and NF-κB activation
	- Suggests mitochondria signaling plays important role in antiviral immune response. 
- RIG-I deficient mice are embryonic lethal
	- Due to liver degeneration
- MAVs-deficient mice are viable and develop normally 
	- Embryonic fibroblasts derived failed to activate NF-κB and IRF3, and had concomitant loss of type I IFN and inflam cytoking induction post infection of RIG-I/MDA5 recognizable RNA
- MAVs is dispensable for type I IFN induction by cytosolic dsDNA, DNA virus, or various TLR ligands
- In pDCs, type I IFN production was unaffected by MAVs loss, suggesting TLRs contribute more preferentially than RLRs to viral recognition. 
	- In other cell types (i.e. fibroblast cells), RLRs play central role in viral recognition and induction of immune response
## Conclusion
- PRRs are expressed in different cellular compartments and recognize different, but overlapping, nucleic acids
- TLR7 & 9 are exclusively expressed in pDCs (sense for viral ssRNA and DNA)
- TLR3 recognizes dsRNA released into the endosome and relies on the adapter TRIF
- RLRs are expressed in the cytoplasm in both immune and nonimmune cells, and recognize RNA produced as a consequence of viral replication. 
- MAVs serves as a common adapter for RLR
- Many viruses encode proteins to counteract activation of TLR and RLR signaling pathways
