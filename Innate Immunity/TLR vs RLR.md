# Toll-like Receptor and RIG-I-like Receptor Signaling

### Intro
- Hosts evoke [[Innate Immune System]] response to eliminate invading pathogens
- Post recognition of viral nucleic acids:
	- Pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) initiate signaling pathways
	- Leads to synthesis of  (1) multiple cytokines and (2) inflammatory cytokines
		1. Type 1 interferon (IFN): IFNα subtypes as well as single IFNβ, IFN, IFN, IFN 
		2. IL-6, IL-12, and TNF
