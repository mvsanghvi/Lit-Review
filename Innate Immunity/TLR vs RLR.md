# Toll-like Receptor and RIG-I-like Receptor Signaling

## Intro
- Hosts evoke [[Innate Immune System]] response to eliminate invading pathogens
- Post recognition of viral nucleic acids:
	- Pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) initiate signaling pathways
	- Leads to synthesis of  (1) multiple cytokines and (2) inflammatory cytokines
		1. Type I interferon (IFN): IFNα subtypes as well as single IFNβ, IFNω, IFNε, IFNκ 
		2. IL-6, IL-12, and TNFα
	- type I IFN plays an essential role in virus elimination
		- Upregulates transcription of many IFN-inducible genes that influence:
			- protein synthesis
			- growth arrest
			- apoptosis
- Toll-like receptor family (TLRs) contain:
	1. Repeats that mediate recognition of their respective pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)
	2. A transmembrane domain that determines cellular localization
	3. Intracellular domain Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) that is required for triggering downstream signaling pathways
- TLRs have >13 members in mammals
	- TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 represent subfamily localized to intracellular compartments (i.e. endosome and ER) recognize viral nucleic acid species
	- TLR1, TLR2, and TLR4-6, are localized on the cell surface mainly recognizes bacterial cell wall components or viral particles
- RIG-I Like receptors (RLRs) include:
	- RIG-I
	- MDA5
	- LGP2
- TLRs are membrane bound, RLRs are cytoplasmic and recognize RNA species produced there
- IFN-inducible protein kinase PKR is implicated in recognizing RNA with short stem-loops (in RLR-independent manner)
- Host cells can respond to intracellular dsDNA released by:
	- DNA viruses
	- Bacteria
	- Host dying cells
		- Occurs in TLR and RLR-independent mechanisms, such as through DAI molecule
			- DAI molecule is a cytoplasmic DNA sensor that binds dsDNA and induces type I IFN & inflam cytokines
				- Other mechanism responds to dsDNA in DAI deficiency
## Recognition of Viruses by TLR3
- Role of TLR3 in dsRNA recognition, including when dsRNA is produced during ssRNA virus replication
- Also implicated in recognition of siRNA (small interfering)
	- Binds to TRL3 in sequence-independent manner, leads to IL-12 and IFNλ, thus suppressing angiogenesis
		- As opposed action to suppress target gene expression
- TLR3 deficient mice show reduced production of type I IFN, IFNλ, and IL-12p40
## Recognition of Viral Nucleic Acids by TLR7-9
- Guanosine and uridine-rich ssRNAs (from HIV) were identified as natural ligands for TLR7
- Human TLR8 preferentially recognizes ssRNA derived from HIV and R-848
	- TLR8 deficient mice responded normally
		- Suggests species-specific function
- TLR9 recognizes cytidine-phosphate-guanosine (CpG) DNA (rare in vertebrates and frequent in bacteria) and viral DNA
- TLR7 and 9 are localized in endosome
	- Endosomal acidification is required for ligand recognition and signaling
- TLR9 intracellular localization is responsible for discrimination between foreign and endogenous DNA due to constricting interactive with inappropriate DNA
- Single missense mutation in gene encoding UNC-93B (12 membrane protein in the ER) abrogated signaling via TLR7-9
	- Mice show defective cytokine production and reduced upregulation of costimulatory molecules
## Recognition of Viruses by RLRs
- RIG-I is essential for the recognition of a series of ssRNA viruses while avoiding self RNA
- ssRNA requires a 5'ppp moiety for RIG-I to bind to and induce type I IFN
	- Probably does so to discriminate between self and foreign RNA
		- Recomb RIG-I protein binds to dsRNA with either a blunt end, 3', or 5'-overhang
			- 3'-overhang dsRNA doesn't form a stable complex (unlike the 5'-overhang), is rapidly unwound by RIG-I and fails to activate signaling
- C-terminal region involving RD is required for recognition of ssRNA and dsRNA, the recognition increases ATPase activity
### Transcriptional Control of the IFNβ Gene
- IFNβ transcription is rapidly induced through cooperative binding to the positive regulatory domain (PRD) of the promoter by 3 distinct families of TFs:
	1. NF-κB: consists of 5 members
		1. RelA (p65)
			- Heterodimer composed of RelA and p50 is the most frequently activated form in TLR & RLR signaling
		2. RelB
		3. C-Rel
		4. p105 (NF-κB1: p50 precursor)
		5. p100 (NF-κB2: p52 precursor)
	2. Activating Transcription Factor 2 (ATF2)/c-Jun
	3. Interferon Regulatory factors IRFs
- Stimulation of TLR or RLR ligands rapidly catalyzes the phospho of IκB proteins by the multiprotein IKK complex
	- IκB proteins are subsequently polyubiquitinated and degraded, allowing for NF-κB translocation into the nucleus. 
		- IKKβ (rather than IKKα) plays essential role in NF-κB activation in TLR & RLR signaling
