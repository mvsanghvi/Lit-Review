# Toll-like Receptor and RIG-I-like Receptor Signaling

## Intro
- Hosts evoke [[Innate Immune System]] response to eliminate invading pathogens
- Post recognition of viral nucleic acids:
	- Pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) initiate signaling pathways
	- Leads to synthesis of  (1) multiple cytokines and (2) inflammatory cytokines
		1. Type I interferon (IFN): IFNα subtypes as well as single IFNβ, IFNω, IFNε, IFNκ 
		2. IL-6, IL-12, and TNFα
	- type I IFN plays an essential role in virus elimination
		- Upregulates transcription of many IFN-inducible genes that influence:
			- protein synthesis
			- growth arrest
			- apoptosis
- Toll-like receptor family (TLRs) contain:
	1. Repeats that mediate recognition of their respective pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)
	2. A transmembrane domain that determines cellular localization
	3. Intracellular domain Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) that is required for triggering downstream signaling pathways
- TLRs have >13 members in mammals
	- TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 represent subfamily localized to intracellular compartments (i.e. endosome and ER) recognize viral nucleic acid species
	- TLR1, TLR2, and TLR4-6, are localized on the cell surface mainly recognizes bacterial cell wall components or viral particles
- RIG-I Like receptors (RLRs) include:
	- RIG-I
	- MDA5
	- LGP2
- TLRs are membrane bound, RLRs are cytoplasmic and recognize RNA species produced there
- IFN-inducible protein kinase PKR is implicated in recognizing RNA with short stem-loops (in RLR-independent manner)
- Host cells can respond to intracellular dsDNA released by:
	- DNA viruses
	- Bacteria
	- Host dying cells
		- Occurs in TLR and RLR-independent mechanisms, such as through DAI molecule
			- DAI molecule is a cytoplasmic DNA sensor that binds dsDNA and induces type I IFN & inflam cytokines
				- Other mechanism responds to dsDNA in DAI deficiency
