# Regulation of [[RIG-I]]-like receptor-mediated signaling: interaction between host and viral factors

## Intro
## Activation of RLR-Mediated Signaling
### Association Between RLRs and MAVS
- RIG-I detects substrate RNAs that have a panhandle double-stranded structure and activates downstream signaling in an ATP-dependent manner.
### Activation of RLR-mediated signaling
### Intracellular localization of RLRs and MAVs
- In the inactivated state, RLRs are uniformly expressed in the cytoplasm
- Under various stress conditions (i.e. viral infection) cells produce stress granules (SGs) to inhibit cellular protein synthesis and store the protein machinery to reinitiate translation after recovery from the stress condition.
	- Machinery= Translationally stalled mRNAs and RNA-binding proteins
### RLRs and their involvement in autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases
- SNPs in DDX58 (encodes RIG-I) associated with Singleton-Merten syndrome (SMS).
- Other mutants associated with SMS (devoid of ATP-independent activity) interact with endogenous ribosomal RNA and activate unintentional ATP-independent IFN production, resulting in SMS development

	- [[ATP hydrolysis and Endogenous RNA]]
