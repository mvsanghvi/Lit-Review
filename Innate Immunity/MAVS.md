# Regulation of MAVS Expression and Signaling Function in the Antiviral Innate Immune Response

## Intro
- The [[Innate Immune System]] is the first line of defense against pathogens.
	- Their cells express specific pattern-recognition receptors to recognize microbial components
- Among viral components, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) are recognized by TLR3,7/8
- RLRs bind dsRNA and trigger antiviral response
- The RLR family has 3 members:
	1. Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)
	2. Melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5)
		- RIG-I and MDA5 are pattern recognition receptors
	3. Laboratory of genetics and physiology protein 2 (LGP2)
		- LGP2 is a regulator of RIG-I and MDA5 mediated signal transduction
- RIG-I (and MDA5) interact with mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS)
	- This induces activation of the TFs interferon regulatory factors (IRF3/7) and nuclear transcription factor-κB (NF-κB)

## Structure and Function of MAVS
- 540-amino acid protein
- Encoded by the nuclear genome
- Is mainly localized on the mitochondrial outer membrane
	- Also detected on peroxisome and mitochondrial-associated endoplasmic reticulum membrane
- 3 domains:
	1. N-terminal caspase recruitment domain (CARD)
	2. Middle proline-rich region (PRR)
	3. C-terminal transmembrane (TM) domain
- MAVS CARD binds to similar CARD present in RIG-I and MDA5, which induces MAVS activation
- After binding to viral components, RIG-I undergoes a conformational change
	1. Exposes their N-terminal tandem CARDs and forms the tetramer via CARDs to be modified with K63-polyubiquitin chains 
	2. K63-linked ubiquitination promotes binding of RIG-I (and MDA5) to MAVS via their CARDs 
	3. MAVS CARD rapidly forms prion-like aggregates, which convert other MAVS on the mitochondrial outer membrane into prion-like aggregates
	4. MAVS binds through its PRR domain of TRAF 2//5/OR 6 which promotes activation of IKK (alpha/beta) complex. 
	5. The complex activates NF-κB to promote the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines
