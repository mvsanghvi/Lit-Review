## TRLs, NLRs, and RLRs Ligands as Immunotherapeutic Agents for Hematopoietic Diseases

## Intro
- Properly functioning [[Innate Immune System]] is essential in maintaining systemic homeostasis
- Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) localize on the surface of inside of immune cells but also non-specialized, non-immune epithelial, endothelial, or fibroblast cells. 
- Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are building blocks of microorganisms that are essential for their survival
	- Are difficult to alter in the process of escaping the host's immune mechanisms
	- Involve wall structure of bacteria, fungi, genetic material, etc.
- PRRs also recognize damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released from damaged host cells and tissue
	- Include hyaluronic acid, histones, mRNAs, cholesterol crystals, etc
- 6 groups of PRRs:
	1. TLRs
	2. RLRs
	3. Nucleotide-binding domain and leucin-rich repeat-containing receptors (NLRs)
	4. C-type lectin receptors (CLRs)
	5. cyclic AMP-GMP synthase and stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING pathway)
	6. AIM2-like receptors (ALRs)
- TLRs and CLRs are both on the cell surface and in intracellular membranes transmembrane receptors
- RLRs, NLRs, and cGAS-STING pathway are intracellular receptor groups
