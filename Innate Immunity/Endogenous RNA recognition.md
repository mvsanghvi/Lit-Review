# Unified mechanisms for self-RNA recognition by RIG-I Singleton-Merten syndrome variants

## Intro
- Superfamily II (SF2) helicases/translocases architecture that consists of :
	1. Central SF2 ATPase domain accompanied by 2 N-terminal tandem caspase activation and recruitment domains (2CARD, only in RIG-I and MDA5) 
	2. C-terminal regulatory domain (CTD or RD)
- SF2 and RD are crucial for RNA-recognition of RLRs, whereas 2CARD communicates successful RNA-binding events to downstream signaling factors
- Simultaneous binding of an RNA ligand AND ATP to RIG-I switches the protein into an activate state in which the otherwise shielded 2CARD is released
- Activated RIG-I homo-tetramerizes via 2CARD and nucleates the polymerization of MAVS to elicit the innate immune signaling cascade
- Similarity of epitopes of viral RNA recognized by RLRs (in particular dsRNA stems) to some endogenous ribonucleic acids has required the immune system to develop mechanisms besides merely recognizing 5' pp/ppp-containing RNA ends to discriminate self from non-self
	- Introducing 2'O-methylations
	- Destabilizing ds parts through A-to-I editing
	- SF2 domain of RLRs itself confers a proof-reading activity by removing RIG-I from self-RNA so as to avoid autoimmunity
	- ATP turnover can lead to translocation on dsRNA stems that could remove the protein from the RNA and reinstall the inactivated state
- SNPs (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) in RLR genes lead to system-wide autoimmune dieases
