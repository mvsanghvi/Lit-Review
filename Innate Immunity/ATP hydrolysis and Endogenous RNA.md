# ATP hydrolysis by the viral RNA sensor RIG-I prevents unintentional recognition of self-RNA

## Intro
- PRRs (pattern recognition receptors) sense pathogen or danger-associated molecular patterns (PAMPS or DAMPS)
	- Trigger molecular cascade that initiates and orchestrates cellular response through activation or i.e. interferon regulatory factors and NF-κB
- RLRs recognize cytosolic foreign RNA
- RIG-I preferentially detect base paired dsRNA (double-stranded) ends with either 5'ppp or 5'pp (diphosphate) moieties
	- Not 2' OH methylated at the first 5' terminal nucleotide
- RIG-I also detects poly-U/UC-rich dsRNA
- MDA5 ligands not well known, but do include >1000 bp dsRNA, high order dsRNA, or AU-rich RNA
- RLRs are superfamily II (SP2) of ATPases, helicases, or nucleic acid translocases members
- RIG-I and MDA5 consist of 2 N-terminal tandem caspase activation and recruitment domains (2CARD), a central ATPase/translocase domain and C-terminal regulatory domain (RD)
	- When activated, RD binds to the 'ppp/'pp-dsRNA end, while SF2 domain interacts with adjacent RNA duplex and forms active ATPase sites.
	- In this conformation, 2CARD module can be K63-linked polyubiquinated.
	- Multiple Ub-2CARD complexes assemble to form a nucleation site for MAVS polymerization into long helical filaments
- MDA5 doesn't recognize terminal structures, but cooperatively polymerizes along dsRNA which supposedly triggers MAVS polymerization
- The SF2 ATPase domain plays a critical role in RIG-I activation
	- Mutation of the 7 SF2 "helicase" motifs resulted in RLRs that are either inactive or signal constitutively
