**Main** 
- Used iPSCs in vitro induction of PSM + derivatives to model human segmentation clock
	- Segmentation clock= Believed to underlie the rhythmic and controlled emergence of somites, which give rise to the segmental patter of the vertebrate axial skeleton. 
- RNA-seq and characterization at each step of induction & differentiation process, expected markers were robustly and appropriately expressed at both transcript and protein levels.

**Oscillations in human in vitro PSM**
- Detected the expression of:
	1. TBX6 and DLL1 at transcript and protein level- Well-established marker of PSM
	2. Hes7- known regulator of segmentation clock
- Made luciferase-reporter system to study Hes7:
	- **human segmentation clock period is 5 hours**
		- 4-6 hours seen in 1**Â°** human embryo samples
	 - **mouse segmentation clock period is 2-3 hours**
