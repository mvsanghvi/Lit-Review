- KOs further down RLR pathway of intersected components with other PRRs 
	- To confirm activation of other PRR is not acting in compensatory manner through shared components
- Over express RIG-I/Mavs to simulate stimulation in foreign presence and look at read-out of somitogenesis
	- KO upstream of NF-κB (or constitutively active NF-κB) to simulate stimulation
- Rescue experiment


- Not all NLRs function as PRRs
	- Instead some respond to presence of cytokines such as interferons
		- RLR could be activated first but also rescued by other PRRs that recognize cytokine response
- **Some NLRs play roles as inhibitors of intracellular signaling pathways mediated by different receptors**
	- So could include Notch too?
