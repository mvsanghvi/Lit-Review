- KOs further down RLR pathway of intersected components with other PRRs 
	- To confirm activation of other PRR is not acting in compensatory manner through shared components
- Over express RIG-I/Mavs to simulate stimulation in foreign presence and look at read-out of somitogenesis
	- KO upstream of NF-κB (or constitutively active NF-κB) to simulate stimulation
- Rescue experiment
- CARD9 KO because of overlap in PRR pathways

- Gap junctions for cell-cell communication would be a form of contact dependent signaling
	- "Gap junctions in animals and plasmodesmata in plants are tiny channels that directly connect neighboring cells. These water-filled channels allow small signaling molecules, called **intracellular mediators**, to diffuse between the two cells. Small molecules and ions are able to move between cells, but large molecules like proteins and DNA cannot fit through the channels without special assistance. 
	- The transfer of signaling molecules transmits the current state of one cell to its neighbor. This allows a group of cells to coordinate their response to a signal that only one of them may have received."
- "In another form of direct signaling, two cells may bind to one another because they carry complementary proteins on their surfaces. When the proteins bind to one another, this interaction changes the shape of one or both proteins, transmitting a signal. This kind of signaling is especially important in the immune system, where immune cells use cell-surface markers to recognize “self” cells (the body's own cells) and cells infected by pathogens" - Khan Academy https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/cell-communication-and-cell-cycle/cell-communication/a/introduction-to-cell-signaling

- Not all NLRs function as PRRs
	- Instead some respond to presence of cytokines such as interferons
		- RLR could be activated first but also rescued by other PRRs that recognize cytokine response
- **Some NLRs play roles as inhibitors of intracellular signaling pathways mediated by different receptors**
	- So could include Notch too?


# Experiment Ideas for studying RIG-I interactions and RNA analysis
1. IP RIG-I & mutants from noninfected & infected HEK 293T RIG-I KO cells and analyzed copurified RNA molecules
2. Analyze on Bioanalyzer RNA chip or agarose gel
3. Sedimentation assays via ultra-centrifugation of sucrose cushions loaded with 80S ribosomes
4. EMSA (electrophoretic mobility shift assay)
5. Fluoresce anisotropy experiments to dissect influence of different RNA ends
6. ATP hydrolysis assays
