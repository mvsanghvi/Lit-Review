- The hippo pathway while initially studied and named due to its effects on organ size control is critical for cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, and fate
- Originally discovered in drosophila [[The Hippo Pathway]]
- The pathway crosses from the cytoplasm into the nucleus of the cell [[The Hippo Pathway]]
- Canonical upstream aspects located in the cytoplasm [[Hippo Signal Transduction Mechanisms in T Cell Immunity]]
	- Sav1
	- Mst 1/2 gets activated by signaling cues from the environment
	- They phosphorylate LATS1/2
	- Mob1
	- They phosphorylate YAP/TAZ 
	- YAP/TAZ either bind to 14-3-3 and are retained in the cytoplasm or are degraded by proteasomes
	- If the pathway is not turned on (no signaling cues from the environment), YAP/TAZ translocates to the nucleus and binds to the TEAD family to drive target gene expression
- Non-canonical aspects of the Hippo Pathway include
	- CDK7

	- YAP1 loss causes arrest of mouse embryo development at E8.5
		- Defective yolk sac vasculogenesis, chorioallontic attachment, and embryonic axis elongation
	- YAP1 represses mesendodermal differentiation in hESCs by regulating NODAL and WNT3 pathway
	- YAP1 deficiency induces transcriptomic and epigenetic modulation in human iPSCs
		- Differential expression in YAP1 deficient of 2511 YAP1 targets compared to WT cells
		- Mesoderm related YAP1 target genes were upregulated in YAP KO cells vs WT
			- HEY2 and RBM47
		- WNT pathway genes downregulated while NODAL was upregulated in YAP KO cells
	- YAP -/- iPSC colonies self-organize in 2D
		- YAP1 activity was modulated upon BMP4 stimulation
			- [[Surface topography guides morphology and spatial patterning of iPSC colonies]]
		- YAP KO  had the same elongation as WT
		- YAP1 doesn't pay a central role for this response to substrate structures.
		- YAP1 isn't a key regulator for self organization of 2D pluripotent stem cell colonies
	- YAP1 deficiency enhances directed endodermal differentiation
		- Mesoderm was separated by 1st dimension of DNAm clustering while WT and YAP KO were separated in the 2nd
			- DNAm changes of mesodermal differentiation similar between YAP KO and WT
		- Strongest differences in hyper and hypo-methylated CpGs after mesodermal differentiation
	- YAP1 is required for early differentiation towards germ layers in embryoid bodies
		- Viability of EBs wasn't reduced due to YAP1 KO
		- EBs from YAP KO kept high OCT4 expression and didn't upregulate germ layer markers
		- To exclude possibility of differentiation potential due to cell damage, rescued with YAP1 with lentiviral transfection
		- Lentiviral transfection did NOT rescue T expression
- Loss of YAP1 in developing gastruloids led to an increase in the percentage of cells positive for mesoderm and endoderm markers, but led to a loss of ectoderm formation  [[YAP1 regulates the self-organized fate patterning of hESC-derived gastruloids]]
