# Toll-like Receptors and Their Crosstalk with Other Innate Receptors in Infection and Immunity


## Introduction
- TLRs were first PRR to be identified
	- Also most well characterized and recognize a wide range of PAMPs
	- Recruit specific set of adaptor molecules that harbor TIR (Toll-IL-1 receptor) domain
		- I.e. MyD88 and TRIF
		- Initiate downstream signaling events that lead to secretion of inflammatory cytokines, type I IFN, chemokines, and antimicrobial peptides
- Intact microbial pathogens are usually composed of a number of PAMPs, which activate multiple PRRs
- Different PRRs may recognize the same PAMP
	- viral RNAs recognized by TLR3, 7l and 8 besides RIG-I MDA5, and NALP3
- TLRs orchestrate pathogen/cell-type specific host immune responses in concert with other PRRs 
## Cooperation between TLRs and Other PRRs in the Regulation of Innate and Adaptive Immune Response to Mycobacterium Infection
- CARD9 is an essential molecule involved in antifungal immunity, and is involved insigaling through multiple PRRs:
	- Dectin1
	- TLRs
	- NOD2
	- RIG-I
## Recognition of Viral Nucleic Acids through TLRs
- Viral nucleic acids act as PAMPs are are recognized by multiple TLRs
	- dsRNA: TLR3
	- ssRNA: TLR7&8
	- DNA: TLR9
## Interplay between TLRs and Other PRRs during Viral Infection
- RNA infection is sense by TLR7 and RLRs
	- Both induce type I IFN
- Hepatitis C is recognized by both TLR3 and RIG-I 
- Interplay btwn TLRs and RLRs in different cell types during infection plays an important role in antiviral responses
