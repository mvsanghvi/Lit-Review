[[Week 0-8 ~ Embryology Overview]]

**PRIMORDIAL GERM CELLS**
- Yolk Sac- Contains cells that give rise to gametes starting during 4th week of gestation (extra embryonic membrane) known as primordial germ cells (PGCs)
	- PGC lineage constitutes the germ line
		- PGCs look round and have pale cytoplasm
		- Migrate from yolk sac to gut tube, then to dorsal body wall @ 4-6 weeks
			- Stranded PGCs give rise to teratomas
		- Multiply while migrating via mitosis
		- Stimulate gonad formation
**GAMETOGENESIS**
- Converts PGCs into spermatozoa or definitive oocytes
	- Different timing depending on sex
		- Males- Dormant from 6th week to puberty
		- Females --> Oogonia --> 1**Â°** oocytes (5th month) --> ovaria follicles resume development (puberty)
			- PGCs referred to as gonocytes
**MEIOSIS 1/2 CHROMOSOME + DNA STRAND # IN SEX CELLS**
- PGCs have 23 pairs (46 total) chromosomes
	- 22 pairs have autosomes (matching/homologous chromosomes)
	- Remaining pair is sex chromosomes
	- Ploidy- # of chromosome copies
		- Diploid= 2n (i.e. PGCs)
		- Haploid= n (i.e. gametes)
	- C value- # of unique 2x DNA molecule copies
		- 1C= haploid 1x DNA gametes (Post meiosis II)
		- 2C= 1x DNA diploid cells (@ initial, telophase, & post mitosis)
		- 4C= 2x DNA diploid cells (@ prepatory phase of both)
- Meiosis is only in germ line
	- Meiosis II
		- Males- Results in 2 definitive spermatocytes = spermatids
		- Females- Unequal. 1 def oocytes (large) & 1 arrested diminutive polar body
