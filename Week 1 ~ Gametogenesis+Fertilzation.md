[[Week 0-8 ~ Embryology Overview]]

1. <u>PRIMORDIAL GERM CELLS</u>
- Yolk Sac- Contains cells that give rise to gametes starting during 4th week of gestation (extra embryonic membrane) known as primordial germ cells (PGCs)
	- PGC lineage constitutes the germ line
		- PGCs look round and have pale cytoplasm
		- Migrate from yolk sac to gut tube, then to dorsal body wall @ 4-6 weeks
			- Stranded PGCs give rise to teratomas
		- Multiply while migrating via mitosis
		- Stimulate gonad formation
2. <u>GAMETOGENESIS</u>
- Converts PGCs into spermatozoa or definitive oocytes
	- Different timing depending on sex
		a) Males- Dormant from 6th week to puberty
		b) Females --> Oogonia --> 1° oocytes (5th month) --> ovaria follicles resume development (puberty)
			-PGCs referred to as gonocytes
3. <u>MEIOSIS 1/2 CHROMOSOME + DNA STRAND # IN SEX CELLS</u>
- PGCs have 23 pairs (46 total) chromosomes
	- 22 pairs have autosomes (matching/homologous chromosomes)
	- Remaining pair is sex chromosomes
	- Ploidy- # of chromosome copies
		a) Diploid= 2n (i.e. PGCs)
		b) Haploid= n (i.e. gametes)
	- C value- # of unique 2x DNA molecule copies
		a) 1C= haploid 1x DNA gametes (Post meiosis II)
		b) 2C= 1x DNA diploid cells (@ initial, telophase, & post mitosis)
		c) 4C= 2x DNA diploid cells (@ prepatory phase of both)
- Meiosis is only in germ line
	- Meiosis II
		a) Males- Results in 2 definitive spermatocytes = spermatids
		b) Females- Unequal. 1 def oocytes (large) & 1 arrested diminutive polar body
4. <u>SPERMATOGENESIS</u>
- <u>Testosterone</u>- Steroid hormone secreted in great amounts at puberty and has a multitude of effects.
		a) Stimulates development of 2° sex characteristics
		b) Triggers growth of testes
		c) Results in maturation of seminiferous tubules
			-Sertoli cells differentiate into a system of seminiferous tubules
		d) Commences spermatogenesis
- Dormant PGCs resume development
	- Divide several times by mitosis
	- Differentiate into spermatogonia, which are located immediately under the basement membrane around the seminiferous tubules, occupying pockets between Sertoli cells
- <u>Blood-testis barrier</u>- Established when adjacent Sertoli cells are interconnected btwn pockets by <u>tight junctions</u>
	**Male Germ Cells Are Translocated to Seminiferous Tubule Lumen During Spermatogenesis**
	- Cells, that arise by mitosis from the spermatogonia, migrate between Sertoli cells from basal to luminal side of the seminiferous epithelium and undergo both meiotic divisions without interruption as spermatogenesis commences.
	- <u>Spermiogenesis</u>- Differentiation of sperm cells, converting them into mature sperm as the complete their migration to the lumen
	**Sertoli Cells are also Instrumental in Spermiogenesis**
	- <u>Tubulobulbar complexes</u>-  A cytoplasmic process that extends into Sertoli cells, and are believed to provide a mechanism by which excess cytoplasm is transferred to Sertoli cells.
	- As cytoplasm is removed, spermatids undergo dramatic changes in shape and internal organization.
		- Results in the formation of spermatozoa from spermatids. Consist of:
			a) Head- Contains condensed nucleus capped by apical vesicle filled with hydrolytic enzymes, which (acrosome) plays an essential role in fertilization
			b) Midpiece- Contains large, helical mitochondria and generates energy to swim
			c) Tail- Contains microtubules that form part of the propulsion system
	- <u>Spermiation</u>- Final step where the last connections with the Sertoli cells breaks, allowing the spermatozoa to be released.  
	**Continual Waves of Spermatogenesis Occur Throughout Seminiferous Epithelium**
	- Spermatogenesis occurs continuously from puberty to death.
	- Gametes are produces in synchronous waves in the local area of the germinal epithelium
		- This is not synchronized with the seminiferous tubules.
	- Daughter cells aren't fully separated, and instead remain connected by slender cytoplasmic bridges
		- Believed these bridges allow passage of small signaling molecules or metabolites.
	- The cycle takes about 74 days
	**Spermatozoa Undergo Terminal Step of Functional Maturation Called Capacitation**
	- During migration, the sperm cells becomes functionally mature to allow it to fertilize
	- Sperm is stored after production in the seminiferous tubules in the lower part of the <u>epididymis</u>, which connects to the vas deferens
	- During ejaculation, sperm, while being propelled, are mixed with nourishing secretions
		- <u>Capacitation</u>- The final step of sperm maturation where changes across the acrosome to  allow for the release of enzymes needed for penetration of the shell around the oocyte.
			- Occurs within the female genital tract
				- Believed to require the secretion of the oviduct
					- Artificially done in the case of IVF
		- As many as 300 million spermatozoa are released, but only a few hundred can navigate all the way past the oviduct. 
			- Sperm survive and retain their capacity to fertilize for 1 to 3 days
5. <u>OOGENESIS</u> 
	**Primary Oocytes Form in Ovaries By 5 Months of Fetal Life**
	- Week 12-Oogonia in genital ridges enter first meiotic prophase, but then switch to dormancy. 
	- **Germinal vesicle**- When dormant 1° oocytes nucleus, which contain the partially condensed prophase chromosomes, becomes very large and watery 
		- This state is believed to protect the oocyte DNA during long period of meiotic arrest
	- **Primordial Follicle**- Made up by capsule of epithelial follicle cells derived from somatic support cells AND its enclosed 1° oocyte.
		- By 5 months, when all oogonia have initiated the first meiotic division, have a peak of 7 million primordial follicles. 
			- Most subsequently degenerate 
				- Birth: 700,000- 2 mill
				- Puberty: 400,000
	**Hormones of Female Cycle Control Folliculogenesis, Ovulation, and Condition of Uterus**
	- From menarche (puberty) to menopause, the menstrual cycle is controlled by monthly cycles of the secretion of hypothalamic, pituitary, and ovarian hormones
		- Results in the monthly production of female gamete and uterus primed to receive fertilized embryo
	- On day 5 of the cycle, increase in secretion by the hypothalamus of the brain and GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) stimulates the pituitary gland to increase the secretion of two gonadtropins (gonadtropic hormones)
		- Rising levels of these regulate later phases of folliculogenesis and proliferative phase in the uterine endometrium
	**About 5 to 12 1° Follicles Resume Development Each Month**
	- **1° follicles**- When the follicular epithelium of a small group of primordial follicles thickens, converting the single-layered follicular epithelium from a layer of squamous cells to cuboidal cells (independent of pituitary gonadotropins and before a particular cycle)
	- **Zona Pellucida**- a thin layer of acellular material secreted by follicles and oocyte together on the oocyte surface
		- Penetrated by thin extension of follicle cells connected to the oocyte cell membrane by intercellular junctions, which remains intact until just before ovulation
			- Believed to convey both developmental signals and metabolic support to the oocyte
	- **Growing Follicles**- When the follicular epithelium of 5 to 12 of these 1° follicles proliferate to form multilayered capsule of follicle cells around the oocyte
		- Some growing follicles stop developing and degenerate
		- Some continue to enlarge in response to rising levels of FSH
			- Take up fluid and develop the **antrum** (central fluid-filled cavity)
			- Called **antral** or **vesicular follicles**
			- Never vascularize
		- Connective tissue of ovarian stroma differentiate into two layers:
			- **Theca interna**- Inner layer
			- **Theca externa**- Outer layer
			- Both layers become vascularized
	**Single Follicle Becomes Dominant and Remainder Degenerate**
	- The follicle that gains primacy continues to enlarge by absorbing fluid, while the remainder of recruited follicles undergo atresia (degenerate)
	- **Cumulus oophorus**- Small mass of follicle cells surrounding the oocyte
	- **Membrana granulosa**- Layer of follicle cells that lines the antral cavity and underlies the basement membrane of the follicle
	- Oocytes and cumulus oophorus increasingly projects into expanding antrum into the membrana granulosa
		- Large, swollen follicle is referred to as a mature vesicular follicle/mature Graafian follicle.
		- Oocyte still has not resumed meiosis
	**Why Is Folliculogenesis Selectively Stimulated in Only a Few Follicles Each Month**
	- It is unknown why only 5 to 12 follicles commence folliculogenesis and even of those few, only one doesn't degenerate. 
		1. Could be because the follicles become progressively more sensitive to FSH stimulation as they advance in development. 
		2. Selection could be regulated by complex feedback system btwn pituitary and ovarian hormones/growth factors. 
5. <u>OVULATION</u> 
	**Resumption of Meiosis and Ovulation Are Stimulated By Ovulatory Surge in FSH and LH**
	- Ovulatory surge, where FSH and LH levels rise very sharply by day 13/14, stimulates the 1° oocyte of remaining mature Graafian follicle to resume meiosis
	**Cumulus Oorphorus Expands in Response to Ovulatory Surge**
	- 
	**Ovulation Depends on Breakdown of Follicle Wall**
	- 
	**Ruptured Follicle Forms Endocrine Corpus Luteum**
