<u>WEEK 1</u>
- Primordial germ cells (PGCs) form at week 4 of gestation
- Gametogenesis  is process during which PGCs choose between becoming spermatozoa or oocytes
	1. SPERMATOGENESIS
	2. OOGENESIS
- All begins with fertilization
- Egg meets sperm
- Egg fuses with sperm
- Egg forms zona pellucida so no other sperm can fuse
- Now called zygote
	- <u>FERTILIZATION</u> [[Week 1]]
	1. Spermatozoa become hypermobile in the vagina's acidic environment and ascend toward the ampulla of the oviduct
	2. Surround ovulated oocyte in ampulla and force their way through the cumulus mass
		- Ovulated follicle likely contains an unknown sperm chemotropic factor that attracts only capacitated sperm by directed swimming to the egg
	3. Spermatozoon binds to oocyte after reaching the zona pellucida surrounding it
		-  Binds in species-specific interaction with glycoprotien sperm receptor moelcule in zona ZP2
	4. Acrosomes is induced to release degradative enzymes
		- Spermatozoon can now successfully penetrate the zona pellucida and reach the surface of the oocyte
		- Sperm-specific binding protein IZUMO1 is exposed
			- A member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and likely an adhesion molecule, named after the Japanese shrine to marriage
	5. Cell membranes of the oocyte and spermatozoon fuse through binding of IZUMO1 and the egg-specific protein JUNO
		- A folate receptor named after the Roman goddess of love and marriage
	6. Fusion immediately causes two events:
		1. Formation of calcium wave that radiates over the surface of the egg once sperm contact occurs
		2. Thousands of cortical granules (located just under the oocyte membrane) are released into the perivitelline space (between the oocyte and zona pellucida)
			- Both events alter the sperm receptor molecules, causing the zona incapable of being penetrated by additional spermatozoa
			- Prevents <u>polyspermy</u>- oocyte being fertilized by >1 spermatozoon
	7. Fusion also initiates meiosis to resume in the oocyte
		- Oocyte completes the 2nd meiotic metaphase and completes anaphase, telophase, and cytokinesis to produce another polar body 
		- Oocyte now considered <u>definitive oocyte</u>- it contains a haploid complement of chromosomes and a 1C quantity of DNA after completion of the 2nd meiotic division (disregarding the sperm's presence)
	8. The fertilized oocyte is now considered a zygote (from Greeking meaning yoked)
		- Does not form single nucleus with both the oocyte's and sperm's chromosomes
		- However, zygote does contain diploid chompletemt of chromosomes and a 2C quanitity of DNA
	9. Post penetration, both the oocyte's and sperm's nuclei swell within the zygote, and are now called <u>Female and male pronuclei</u> respectively 
	10. The pronuclei membranes disappear quickly to allow replication of both maternal and paternal chromosomes to prepare for cleavage
		[[Week 1]]
- Zygote undergoes rapid cell division known as cleavage in the first 12-24 hours after the zygote is formed
	- Goes from 2 to 4 to 8 to 16 to 32 to 64 cells
	- At the 32 to 64 cell stage, becomes known as the morula
		- <u>CLEAVAGE</u> [[Week 1]]
	**Cleavage Subdivides Zygote Without Increasing Its Size**
	- <u>Cleavage</u>- When the zygote undergoes rapid mitotic cell division.
		- Occurs 24 hours post fertilization
		- No cell growth
		- <u>Blastomeres</u>- Smaller daughter cells that the zygote subdivides into during cleavage
		- 1st cleavage- Zygote --> 2 blastomeres
		- 2nd cleavage- 4 blastomeres (40 hours)
		- 3 days- 6 to 12 cells
		- 4 days- 16 to 32 cells (<u>morula</u> at 32 blastomeres)
	- Embryo does not increase in size and remains enclosed in zona pellucida
	**Segregation of Blastomeres Into Embryoblast and Trophoblast Precursors**
	- Cells of morula give rise to 
		1. embryo proper 
		2. extraembryonic membranes
		3. Placenta + related structures 
	- Cells segregate during cleavage depending on path they will follow
	1. At 8 cell stage- blastomeres flatten and develop inside-out polarity that maximizes cell-cell contact with adjacent blastomeres, which were previously round and loosely adherent
	2. <u>Compaction</u>- Reorganization of blastomeres where outer surface is convex and inner surfaces are concave and requires change in blastomere cytoskeleton
	3. Blastomeres segregate, either to center of morula or outside
		- Center=<u>Inner cell mass</u> (icm)
			- Aka <u>embryoblast</u> bc gives rise to embryo proper
		- Outside= <u>Trophoblast</u>
			- Primary source of fetal component of placenta
	**Morula Develops Fluid-Filled Cavity and Is Transformed Into Blastocyst**
	- Development Day 4: The morula begins to absorb fluid at 30 cell stage
		1. Trophoblast, while differentiating, assembles into tightly adherent epithelium due to deposit of <u>E-cadherin</u> on later cell surfaces
			- E-cadherin deposition also leads to formation of intercellular junctions:
				a. tight junctions
				b. gap junctions
				c. adherens junctions
				d. desmosomes
		2. Forming trophoblast cells express basally polarized membrane <u>Na/K+ ATPase</u>, which allows them to transport and regulate exchange of metabolites between inside and outside of morula.
			- Inside of morula= Toward icm
			- Outside of morula= Maternal environment of oviduct
		3. Na/K pumps sodium into morula interior with water following bc osmosis
			- Becomes blastocoelic fluid
		4. As hydrostatic pressure increases, a large cavity (<u>blastocoel/blastocyst cavity</u>) forms
		5. <u>Blastocyst</u>- Forms once embryoblast cells (icm) form compact mass on one side of blastocoel and trophoblast organizes thin, single-layered epithelium
			a. <u>Embryonic pole</u>- Side with icm
			b. <u>Abembryonic pole</u>- Opposite side of icm	
			[[Week 1]]
- Cells within the morula start to differentiate, becoming two specialized cell types that separate and self arrange themselves in specific configurations
- Self arrange into outer layer (trophoblasts) and inner cell mass (ICM) with large cavity between the trophoblasts and ICM known as the blastocoel cavity
	- The entire structure is referred to as the blastocyst
	- 8. <u>END OF FIRST WEEK: INITIATING IMPLANTATION</u> [[Week 1]]
	**Blastocyst Hatches From Zona Pellucida Before Implanting**
	1. Day 3-4 of development: The morula reaches the uterus
	2. Day 5: The blastocyst bores a hole into the zona pellucida and squeezes out
		- Blastocyst is naked and can directly interact with the endometrium
	3. The hatched blastocyst becomes tightly adherent to the uterine lining
	4. <u>Decidual reaction</u>- Progesterone is secreted by the corpus luteum by <u>decidual cells</u> when adjacent cells in the endometrial stroma sense the blastocyst
		1. Progesterone secretion keeps uterine lining from sloughing off, keeping the lining in a "favorable state"
			1. Normally, the corpus degenerates after 13 days if there is no implantation
			2. In the case of implantation, <u>trophoblast</u> produces human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to support the corpus, thus maintaining progesterone supply 
				1. Referred to as "maternal recognition of pregnancy"
	5. Corpus luteum continues to secrete large amounts of progesterone until the placenta itself does the same 
		1. Corpus luteum involutes to become the corpus albicans
	6. Endometrial glands in the area 
	**Implantation in Abnormal Site Results in Ectopic Pregnancy**
	- Blastocyst can accidentally implant on:
		- Peritoneal cavity
		- Surface of ovary
		- Within oviduct
		- Other abnormal sites in uterus
	- Response is increased vascularity and other supportive changes to allow the blastocyst to survive
	- Called ectopic pregnancy
		- Endangers mother's life because blood vessels that form are apt to rupture as a result of embryo/placental growth.
		- Symptoms include abdominal pain and/or vaginal bleeding
		- Drug (methyltrexate) or surgical intervention is necessary to interrupt the pregnancy
		- [[Week 1]]
<u>WEEK 2</u>
- Blastocyst becomes more specialized as the ICM starts to differentiate
- First ICM forms two layers, epiblast and hypoblast
	- EPIBLAST
	- HYPOBLAST
	- EpSCs
- As the layers form, begin to form a new cavity
	- AMNIOTIC CAVITY
	- PRIMARY YOLK SAC
	Week 2 is the "rule of twos" week[[Week 2]]
	1. <u>BECOMING FULLY IMPLANTED</u>
		- Days 6-9: Embryo becomes fully implanted in endometrium
		- <u>Cytoptrophoblast</u>- Cells that line trophoblast wall and retain their cell membranes
			- Secretes proteolytic enzymes to break down the ecm between endometrial cells
		- <u>Syncytiotrophoblast</u>- Mass of cytoplasm containing numerous dispersed nuclei
			- Some proliferating cells lose their membranes and coalesce into syncytium
				- Increases in volume through week 2
					- Cells detach from cytotrophoblast at embryonic pole and fuse with syncytium
			- Finger-like processes extend from it and penetrate between the separating endometrial cells and pull the embryo
				- Gradually envelopes the blastocyst as implantation progresses
			- *<u>Cytoptrophoblast</u> and <u>Syncytiotrophoblast</u> contribute to extraembryonic membranes, not the embryo proper*
				- *They, along with associated extraembryonic mesoderm and uterus, initiate the formation of the placenta*
		- Day 9: Syncytiotrophoblast blankets entire blastocyst except for abembryonic pole region
		- Coagulation plug of acellular material seals small hole where blastocyst implanted
	2. <u>EMBRYOBLAST REORGANIZES INTO EPIBLAST AND HYPOBLAST</u>
		- Pre-implantation, ICM differentiates into 2 epithelial layers
		- Day 8: Embryo consists of:
			1. <u>Epiblast</u>- Distinct external/upper layer of columnar cells
			2. <u>Hypoblast/Primitive endoderm</u>- Internal/lower lever of cuboidal cells
		- Extracellular basement membrane is laid down between the two layers
			- The two-layerd embryoblast= <u>Bilaminar embryonic disc</u>/<u>Bilaminar blastoderm</u>
		- With formation of the disc, define the primitive <u>dorsal-ventral axis</u>
	3. <u>DEVELOPMENT OF AMNIOTIC CAVITY</u>
		- Day 8: Amniotic cavity appears as fluid collects between epiblast cells and overlying trophoblast
		1. A layer of epiblast cells expands towards embryonic pole and differentiates into amnion
			- <u>Amnion</u>- Thin membrane that separates amniotic cavity from the cytotrophoblast
				- 1 out 4 extrambryonic membranes:
					1. Amnion
					2. Chorion
					3. Yolk Sac
					4. Allantois
		2. Amnion starts smaller than blastocyts cavity, then expands steadily
		3. Amnion encloses entire embryo by week 8
	4. <u>DEVELOPMENT OF YOLK SAC AND CHORIONIC CAVITY</u>
		- Formation of yolk sac result of:
			a. Proliferation of hypoblast cells
			b. 2 Successive waves of cell migration
			1. Day 8- first migration wave forms 1° yolk sac (aka Heueser's or exocoelomic membrane)
				1. Extraembryonic mesoderm forms simultaneously, filling remainder of the blastocyst cavity with loosely arranged cells
					- Humans: Extraembryonic mesoderm originates from hypoblast/1° yolk sac
					- Mice: Arises from caudal end of primitive streak
			2. Day 12/13- 1° yolk sac is displaced by 2nd migration wave, which form 2° yolk sac
				- 1° yolk sac eventually degrades
			3. Extraembryonic/chorionic cavity forms by splitting extraembryonic mesoderm into 2 layers
			4. <u>Chorion</u>- What the outer wall of the blastocyst is referred to as when the chrorionic cavity separates the embryo with its attached amnion and yolk sac from it
				- Splitting of extraembryonic mesoderm into 2 layers, results in amnion, yolk sac, and chorion also splitting into 2-layers
					- Amnion and chorion consist of extraembryonic ectoderm and mesoderm
					- Yolk sac consists of extraembryonic endoderm and mesoderm
			5. Day 13- Embryonic disc with dorsal amnion and ventral yolk sac is suspended in chorionic cavity only by <u>connecting stalk</u> (thick stalk of extraembryonic mesoderm)
			6. <u>Definitive yolk sac</u>- Formed after formation and splitting of extraembryonic mesoderm
				- Is 2-layered structure
					1. Inside= Hypoblast-derived endoderm
					2. Outside= Mesoderm
			7. Week 4: Extraembryonic mesoderm on yolk sac outer layer is major site for hematopoiesis, and primordial germ cells can first be identified here
			8. Beyond Week 4: Yolk sac rapidly overgrown by embryonic disc
			9. In rare case known as <u>Meckel's diverticulum</u>, the yolk sac doesn't disappear, but instead persists in form of a digestive track anomaly.
		- Remember that yolk sac is extraembryonic membrane that has its own cavity
	5. <u>UTEROPLACENTAL CIRCULATORY SYSTEM BEGINS TO DEVELOP DURING THE SECOND WEEK</u>
		- Nutrient uptake and waste elimination process changes
			1. Week 1: Embryo uses simple diffusion
			2. Day 9: Begins to form <u>uteroplacental circulation</u>- System by which maternal and fetal blood flow through the placenta to come into close proximity and exchange gases by metabolic diffusion
				- Rapid embryo growth causes the formation of the more effecient system 
					1. Trophablastic lacunae (vacuoles) open within the syncytiotrophoblast
					2. Maternal capillaries near the syncytiotrophoblast expand, forming maternal sinusoids that anastomose with the tropblastic lacunae
						- <u>Anastomose</u>-The connection of separate parts of a branching system to form a network, as of leaf veins, blood vessels, or a river and its branches
			3. Day 11-13: Anastomosation continues and cytotrophoblast proliferates locally to form extensions growing into syncytiotrophoblast
			4. Extensions grow out into blood-filled lacunae while covered in syncytiotrophoblast- <u>1° chorionic stem villi</u>
			5. Day 16: Cytrtrophoblast's extraembryonic mesoderm penetrates core of the stem villi- <u>2° chorionic stem villi</u>
			6. End of week 3: 2° villi give rise to blood vessels connected to vessels forming in the embryo proper
				- Estabilishes a working uteroplacental circulation (primitive heart starts beating day 22)
				- Villi with differentiated blood vessels- <u>3° chorionic stem villi</u>
		-  Diffusing nutrients, gases, and wastes between maternal and fetal blood cross four tissue layers
			1. Endothelium of villus capillaries
			2. Loose connective tissue in the core of the villus
			3. Syncytiotrophoblast layer
			4. Cytotrophoblast player
				- Maternal layers are not crossed because they do not invade the trophoblastic lacunae
		[[Week 2]]
<u>WEEK 3</u>
- Gastrulation
	- Form 3 germ layers
		- ENDODERM
		- ECTODERM
		- MESODERM
	- Bilaminar disk forms
	- Ingressing to form primitive streak
	- Primitive node also formed
	- Establishes directionality as well and starts to form elongated structure instead of round ball
	[[Week 3]]
		- **Gastrulation**- Heralded in by the formation of the ps (primitive streak)
		- **Primitive Streak**- Thickening with midline groove which forms around D15
		
		<u>OVERVIEW OF GASTRULATION FORMING THREE 1° GERM LAYERS</u>
		- Over 3 days, the ps elongates to 1.2 of the embryonic disc. Prim groove becomes more defined
			- Ps @ cranial end expands into prim node with depression called prim pit.
			- Major body axes now identifiable
				a. Cranial-caudal
				b. Dorsal-ventral
		- Epiblast cells move toward, then enter, then migrate from PS as individual cells
			- **Ingression**- Cells through PS into interior of embryo
		
		<u>FORMATION OF DEFINITIVE ENDODERM</u>
		- **Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)**- Epiblast cells move into ps on D16
			a. **Epithelium**- Sheet of cells tightly interconnect via their lateral surfaces
			b. **Mesenchyme**- Loosely connected irregularly/stellate shaped cells
			c. **Pseudopodia**- Epiblast cells elongate (flask/bottle shaped) & detach
				- Allows them to migrate through ps between epiblast and hypblast
			d. **Definitive Endoderm**- Replaces hypoblast through ppib cells 1st ingression
				- Gives rise to lining of future gut/gut derivatives
		
		<u>FORMATION OF INTRAEMBRYONIC MESODERM</u>
		- **Intraembryonic mesoderm**- 3rd germ layer formed by epiblast cells diverging into space between epiblast and nascent definitive endoderm from ps
			- Mat formed reorganizes into:
				1. Cardiogenic mesoderm
				2. [[Paraxial Mesoderm]]
				3. Nephrotome/intermediate mesoderm
				4. Lateral plate mesoderm
					- Notochordal process= Primitive node @ midline undergoing 5th mesodermal cell population to form a thick wall midline test 
		
		<u>FORMATION OF ECTODERM</u>
		- Epiblast cells stop moving to and ingress through ps after Definitive Endoderm formation and remaining epiblast make up ectoderm and soon after gastrulation's done
			- Ectoderm quickly differentiates into:
				1. Neural Plate
				2. Surface Ectoderm
			- Morphogenic changes occur to 3 germ layers to form prim organ rudimentss 
				a. Reality= 2+ germ layers collab for organ rudimentary formation
				b. **Organogenesis**= Organ rudiment --> Organ systems
		
		<u>SPECIES OF GASTRULATION = MOVING CELLS TO NEW LOCALS AND ORGAN RUDIMENTS</u>
		***Fates of Epiblast Cells Depends on Site of Origin***
		- Most cells in epiblast and ps are pluripotent. Specified during migration
		- **Prechordal plate**= 1 of most misunderstood  structures in human embryo
			- Undergoes EMT to form craniomost midline head mesoderm
		- Mesoderm formation begins during early ps stage
			-  **Cardiogenic mesoderm**- Prospective cardiogenic mesoderm in epiblast moves to middle part of ps then migrates cranially
		- @ Mid-ps stage, prospective {notochord, head mesoderm, somites, intermediate mesoderm, plate mesoderm} lose prospective status
		- Notochordal process fully formed by D20
			- Then is hollow tube to plate plate to solid rod
		***Paraxial Mesoderm Differs in Head and Trunk***
		- Somites= 1st pair at D20, block-like mesoderm condensations that form cranial to caudal until D30, with 42-44 pair flanking notochord.
			- Give rise to most of axial skeleton and caudal most pairs disappear
		***Intermediate and Lateral Plate Mesoderm Forms Only in Trunk***
		- IM- small cylindrical condensation that makes urinary and parts of genital system
		- LPM- Flattened sheet
		***Formation of Neural Plate***
		- D18-D20, the thickened neural plate folds into the Neural tube, which tapers into the brain and the lateral lips give rise to the neural crest cells
			- Brain already visibly divided into:
				1. Forebrain
				2. Midbrain
				3. Hindbrain
		
		 <u>CAUDAL ELONGATION OF EMBRYO</u>
		 - Driven by neuromesodermal stem cells. 
			 - Stem cell differntiation is driven by somite formation.
				 - As somites increase, somite-derived retinoic acid increases, causes Fgf8 and Wnt to decrease, which drives differentation into neural plate
		<u>1° VS 2° BODY DEVELOPMENT</u>
		- PS % of embryo length: 
			- D16: 50%
			- D22: 10-20%
			- D26: Disappears
		- D20- PS remnants swell to make tail bud
			- This gives rise to most caudal structures
		- 1° BD= Gastrualtion
		- 2° BD= Rudimentary tail formation w/o germ layer formation
		[[Week 3]]
